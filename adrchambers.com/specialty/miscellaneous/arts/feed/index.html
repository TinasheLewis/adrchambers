										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1">Richard is a mediator and arbitrator with over 10 years’ experience. He has mediated a wide range of disputes including claims arising out of the performance of services, supplying products, personal and professional negligence, compensation for damages, insurance coverage, dealership obligations, and motor vehicle accidents.</p>
<p class="p1">Richard has arbitrated disputes of a commercial nature including insurance coverage and wrongful termination of employment. Richard is also an arbitrator for the Canadian Transportation Agency for transportation disputes and for the Ontario Farm Products Marketing Commission for pricing disputes for juice apples.</p>
<p class="p2">Richard practiced as a civil litigator for over 45 years, was appointed as Queen’s Counsel in 1978, certified as a specialist in civil litigator in 1988, and obtained a Master of Laws degree in Alternative Dispute Resolution from York University in 1999.

<p class="p2">Richard’s approach to mediation is proactive without being intrusive. Prior to the commencement of a mediation or an arbitration, he will telephone counsel to assist them in designing a procedure to fit their case. He will work with counsel to create an atmosphere in which they can present their case to the satisfaction of everyone involved.</p>
