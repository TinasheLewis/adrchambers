										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Every area of business is having difficulties during Covid-19 and the legal industry is no exception. With regular court operations and limitation periods suspended, there will be challenges in moving files along. It is critical while social distancing to move legal services online as much as possible in order to keep the legal system moving. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Online Mediation:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">At ADR Chambers, online Mediation services are offered with experienced mediators. Mediations run just as they would in-person and we have a support team ready to assist parties who may have difficulties with the technology.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Online Mediation can be helpful for matters that would otherwise use Mediation or for cases where an expedient resolution would be helpful for one or both parties. By moving matters along and getting expedient results, lawyers will be able to continue to work on files as they normally would and clients will get faster resolutions. This will give all parties certainty for their matters during these uncertain times, and put them in a better position than they would be if they had to wait for court services.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s2">Court Replacement &#8211; Arbitration:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Although court operations are suspended for the foreseeable future, many parties still want resolutions to matters decided by someone else, when they cannot be worked out between the parties. </span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For years, parties have been using Arbitration services as a viable alternative to attending court. In Arbitrations, you are still able to make arguments and use any process the parties and the Arbitrator can agree on. This could look as close to a full court proceeding as the parties would like.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">A major benefit of Arbitrations is that they can be argued from the safety and comfort of everyone’s own home during social distancing. They allow experienced neutrals, including former judges, to make binding determinations. Arbitrations get matters resolved so that the parties can move forward and make future decisions with the knowledge of the result of their case instead of having to make decisions with their legal matter hanging in abeyance.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">While the courts’ regular operations are suspended, it is important to think about how lawyers can best serve clients and continue to provide valuable services. By using online Mediation and Arbitration services, lawyers are still able to advocate for their clients in a meaningful and personal way, without having to wait for the courts to commence regular operations.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>By Frank Zaid (link to <a href="https://adrchambers.com/neutral/frank-zaid/">https://adrchambers.com/neutral/frank-zaid/</a>)</p>
<p>www.franchiseinfor.ca</p>
<p>July 10, 2012</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Q: </strong>Are we more likely, today and in the future, to see attempts to resolve franchise disputes through mediation or arbitration?</p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Absolutely, yes. There are many factors behind this trend, including franchise legislation, judicial decisions, industry guidelines and the franchise media.</p>
<p>The franchise relationship is governed principally by the franchise agreement, which is between a franchisor—<em>i.e. </em>the entity that owns the franchise system rights—and the franchisee—<em>i.e. </em>the individual who obtains the right to operate a business in accordance with the franchisor’s business standards and trademarks.</p>
<p>Franchise legislation has been enacted in five provinces: Alberta, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Manitoba (in that order). In Quebec, franchising is generally regulated under the <em>Civil Code</em>, which recognizes franchise agreements as contracts of adhesion.</p>
<p>Over the years, franchise disputes have been heard by the courts on an individual basis with relation to the specific franchisee and franchisor. There has also been a rapid escalation of multi-franchisee disputes, however, revolving around issues common to all or virtually all of the franchisees—both past and present—within a system.</p>
<p>At the same time, franchising has become big business in Canada, comprising more than 78,000 units across the country, directly employing more than one million people, generating 10 per cent of the national gross domestic product (GDP) and accounting for one out of every five dollars consumers spend on goods and services—and some 40 per cent of all retail sales.</p>
<p>After the introduction of class action legislation in all provinces except Manitoba, disputes common to distinguishable groups of all or substantially all of the franchisees within well-known systems have become the subject matter of very large and significant lawsuits. With all of this activity, it is highly likely many more franchise disputes will be directed to alternative dispute resolution (ADR)—<em>i.e.</em> a method of resolution outside the usual process of litigation in court.</p>
<p><strong>Principles of legislation</strong></p>
<p>All Canadian franchise legislation is founded on two major principles.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Disclosure and rescission</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The first principle involves the requirement for a franchisor to provide a disclosure document—which outlines in considerable detail the franchise being offered—to the prospective franchisee, unless an exemption is available. The disclosure document must be delivered at least 14 days before any agreement is signed, subject to certain provincial exceptions, or any consideration is paid.</p>
<p>The franchisee then has a statutory right to rescind the agreement within two years, in the case of no disclosure, or 60 days, in the case of deficient disclosure, after the date he/she entered the franchise agreement. If the agreement is indeed rescinded, the franchisor is required to (a) refund any money received from or on behalf of the franchisee to him/her, other than money for inventory, supplies or equipment, (b) purchase any inventory, supplies and equipment at a price equal to the purchase price paid by the franchisee and (c) compensate the franchisee for any losses incurred in acquiring, setting up and operating the franchise, less the amounts paid for the inventory, supplies and equipment.</p>
<p>Given the costs of establishing a franchise in some of the larger industry sectors—such as hotels, car rental facilities, automotive dealerships, full-scale restaurants and discount grocery stores—and multiplied by the number of franchisees operating within a particular system, the potential exposure of a franchisor to rescission claims can easily run into hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Fair dealing</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The second principle of franchise legislation provides the statutory obligation of a duty of fair dealing in the performance and enforcement by each party under the franchise agreement. A breach of this duty, coupled with an alleged breach of an obligation or the assertion of a right under the franchise agreement, will expose a franchisor to a significant claim for breach of contract.</p>
<p>Again, if the alleged breach is in respect of a matter common to all or substantially all of the franchisees within a given system, the aggregate potential damages claim against a franchisor can also run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Regulating mediation</strong></p>
<p>In 2005, the Uniform Law Commission of Canada (ULCC) approved a model <em>Uniform Franchises Act</em>, a model <em>Disclosure Regulation</em> and a model <em>Mediation Regulation</em>.</p>
<p>The model <em>Mediation Regulation</em> included detailed provisions allowing either party to a franchise to require a dispute to be submitted to mediation. Of the three provinces—Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Manitoba—that have adopted franchise legislation since the ULCC Report, so far only New Brunswick has substantially adopted the mediation process.</p>
<p>While Ontario’s <em>Arthur Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000</em> does not include a mediation process, the province’s <em>Rules of Civil Procedure</em> now include a program of mandatory mediation for managed cases in various areas. Actions placed on the Commercial List—<em>i.e.</em> the division of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice that hears complex commercial cases—in the Toronto region as determined by the court rules are exempted from this procedure. Matters that may be placed on the Commercial List include applications, motions and actions that in essence involve, according to the rules, “suitable complex cases under the <em>Arthur Wishart Act</em>,” among others.</p>
<p>While mandatory mediation does not apply to franchise cases on the Commercial List, the Court practice rules establishing the Commercial List state, “resort to the techniques of ADR, where appropriate, is recognized and encouraged as an effective aid in the disposition of issues and matters on the Commercial List … it is the duty of the case management judge and the obligation of counsel to explore methods to resolve the contested issues between the parties, including the resort to ADR, at the case conferences and on whatever other occasions it may be fitting to do so . . . at any time, particularly on consent of the parties, the case management judge may refer any issue for ADR, as appears appropriate.”</p>
<p>Indeed, government initiatives to promote mediation of franchise disputes are present in all provincial franchise legislation. Taking Ontario’s legislation as an example, regulations under the <em>Arthur Wishart Act</em> dealing with the content of disclosure documents provide that “if an internal or external mediation or other alternative dispute resolution process is used by a franchisor in disputes with a franchisee, the disclosure document must include a description of the mediation or other ADR process, and the circumstances when the process may be invoked.”</p>
<p>In addition, every disclosure document in the regulated provinces is required to include a statement similar to the following passage from the Ontario legislation:</p>
<p>“Mediation is a voluntary process to resolve disputes with the assistance of an independent third party. Any party may propose mediation or other dispute resolution process in regard to a dispute under the franchise agreement and the process may be used to resolve the dispute if agreed to by all parties.”</p>
<p>Also, disclosure documents under all provincial franchise legislation require a statement—including a description of details—indicating if the franchisor has been found liable in any civil action of misrepresentation, unfair or deceptive business practices or violations of laws that regulate franchises or businesses. This would include any failure to provide proper disclosure to a franchisee or a civil action involving such allegations pending against the franchisee. There is no requirement, however, to disclose whether or not a dispute has been submitted to ADR or, if it has, the results or settlement of any such dispute.</p>
<p><strong>Independent assistance</strong></p>
<p>Independent mediators, arbitrators and organizations are now recognizing the utility and application of ADR as a means of resolving franchise disputes. ADR Chambers Canada, for example, established an expert panel of ‘neutrals’—including retired judges, experienced lawyers and other dispute resolution professionals—to specialize in franchise disputes as of January 1, 2012.</p>
<p>“I sense that the trend to enter into mediation, whether voluntarily, by contract, or by judicial order, will continue to increase,” writes Mark Kirsch, one of the authors of a recent article in Law Journal Newsletters’ (LJN’s) <em>Franchising Business and Law Alert</em>. “If you compare the cost of mediation with the possible cost of litigation, the resulting ratio clearly favours mediation.”</p>
<p>Indeed, all aspects of franchising today point to the need and desirability of having disputes submitted to ADR and, in particular, to mediation whenever possible. Franchisees and franchisors alike should carefully consider such options, to avoid costly litigation before the courts and to obtain an early resolution agreed to by both sides.</p>
<p>The ADR community, too, should prepare itself for being called upon more frequently to assist in resolving franchising disputes, by ensuring a sufficient number of mediators and arbitrators are well-versed in the dynamics, business issues and legal regulations governing the franchise relationship, so as to develop a better understanding, promote efficiency and encourage practical resolutions that will reflect fair and realistic results for all of the parties concerned.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p class="p2"><span class="s1">by Aidan Macnab</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1"><a href="https://www.canadianlawyermag.com/surveys-reports/boutique-firm-rankings/faster-cheaper-with-less-process-top-10-arbitration-chambers/276097">Canadian Lawyer magazine</a></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">13 May 2019</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Though he enjoyed his work as a commercial litigator, Allan Stitt found clients were rarely satisfied with the results. If they won &#8211; well, big deal, it was inevitable anyway. And if they lost, they felt betrayed. Litigation wasn&#8217;t appearing, to him, an effective path to resolution.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>&#8220;Winning didn&#8217;t feel nearly as good as losing felt bad,&#8221; says Stitt, president and CEO of ADR Chambers.</p>
<p>It was a common refrain from those leading the 2019 Top 10 Arbitration Chambers that the catalyst for making the transition to ADR was the sorry state of the civil justice system, recently degraded even further by delays stemming from the Jordan decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;ve really seen in the last 20 years is a quiet revolution in a civil justice system, where the expectation of counsel and their clients is that you&#8217;re more likely to see your case resolved in a meeting room than in a courtroom,&#8221; says Paul Torrie, founder and president of top arbitration chamber Global Resolutions, which he founded in 1996 and which has since grown to a panel of 16. Global Resolutions does arbitration in every area but family and labour law, and it offers mediation and class action services.</p>
<p>But there is a movement to continue the momentum toward faster, more efficient, less expensive dispute resolutions and a schism in the collective vision of where ADR needs to go. Stitt and others at the top arbitration chambers see change in the future of ADR, but they say professionals in the practice often disagree on the form it should take. Artificial intelligence tools are quickly becoming sophisticated enough to replace the flesh-and-blood meeting room negotiations, but at what cost? Some in the practice say that businesses want fast results and it&#8217;s the job of arbitration chambers to deliver them. Others say that due process cannot be sacrificed for expediency.</p>
<p>According to Stitt, the future of arbitration is &#8220;faster, cheaper with less process.&#8221; He says the &#8220;vast majority&#8221; of disputes are not fit for the courts or traditional ADR. It is up to professionals like him and his peers to be creative and develop faster, less expensive processes &#8211; even at the expense of due process. The test, Stitt says, as to whether someone is sufficiently forward thinking is if they are comfortable with a dispute resolution being subject to the flip of a coin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of my colleagues would say that that&#8217;s heresy,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The business people that I&#8217;ve talked to about it want to stand up and cheer.&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Stitt adds that much of the pushback concerning due process, which is focused on the satisfaction earned by parties through the process, comes from a mistaken confidence that long, drawn-out processes produce a feeling of fairness and justice.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re less concerned about fairness because they think that, even in the long processes, they don&#8217;t get fair results,&#8221; he says. &#8220;So, they&#8217;re going to be just as uncomfortable in a short process as they will [be] in a long process.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we have to do is find a way to make due process faster and more efficient,&#8221; Torrie says. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think we can abandon due process. It&#8217;s the bedrock of our system. So, we have to find more efficient ways to deliver due process.&#8221;</p>
<p>Stitt, with the support of partners at Osler Hoskin &amp; Harcourt LLP, went out on his own and started an ADR practice. Over 25 years, he has built ADR Chambers into one of the largest providers of private arbitration and mediation in the world. At the beginning of 2019, ADR Chambers and York Street Chambers &#8211; which was also voted on to the Top Arbitration Chambers list &#8211; merged and are now under the same management.</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>Canadian Lawyer determined the top arbitration chambers through a month-long survey of legal professionals across the country. Since ADR Chambers and YorkStreet Dispute Resolution Group Inc. had merged at the beginning of the year but were separately voted on to the list, they are included as one among the top 10. The nine other top arbitration chambers are: Alternative Resolution Group Inc., Arbitration Place, British Columbia International Commercial Arbitration Centre, Canadian Commercial Arbitration Centre, Global Resolutions Inc., Amicus Chambers, Ottawa Dispute Resolution Group Inc. and Bay Street Chambers.</p>
<p>In 2012, Brian Casey founded Bay Street Chambers, which practises commercial arbitration, split evenly between domestic and international matter. The firm&#8217;s work focuses on commercial disputes, construction, shareholder and M&amp;A, technology and intellectual property. Casey says he&#8217;s recently seen an upsurge in technology and intellectual property arbitrations. While historically, he says, tech firms did not use arbitration, they appear to have changed their minds.</p>
<p>In 2019, a pressing issue for all arbitrators in Canada, he says, is the trend of companies using arbitration clauses to extricate themselves from class actions.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re seeing is the courts are struggling to maintain the ability to have small consumer matters dealt with by class actions in the face of an arbitration clause,&#8221; Casey says. &#8220;And the courts<br />
are, in my opinion, stretching the law to try and attain justice but are harming commercial arbitration precedence.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some provinces have passed laws to the effect that arbitration clauses are void with respect to consumers. Casey says the courts sometimes offer this benefit to commercial entities because it is being given to consumers, &#8220;and that is a problem.&#8221; He says provinces need to look at the legislation more carefully.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to change the legislation one way or the other, because what&#8217;s happening is courts are now saying we can in fact hear commercial cases, even though the arbitration clause is valid,&#8221; Casey says. &#8220;And then the question becomes, OK, how far are people going to try and push that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Though he maintains that legislation is needed, Casey says a recent Supreme Court decision gave guidance on business customers subject to arbitration clauses that are participating in class actions. In TELUS Communications Inc. v. Avraham Wellman, customers of the telecommunications company formed a class action alleging TELUS rounded up calls to the next minute and thus overcharged them without notification. The motions judge certified the class as containing both consumer and non-consumer claims and declined to stay that of the non-consumers. TELUS argued that the non-consumer claims are governed by the mandatory arbitration clause and ought to be stayed. The Court of Appeal of Ontario ruled the motions judge had it right, but the Supreme Court differed &#8211; in a five-to-four majority &#8211; finding the judge was entitled to stay the claims and force the business customers to arbitrate.</p>
<p>Top arbitration chamber Alternative Resolution Group Inc. is led by Shari Novick and Guy Jones. Earlier in her career, Novick was a litigator in private practice, but she says she was drawn to the neutrality of ADR. She became an arbitrator with the Financial Services Commission of Ontario and served two terms in the office of adjudication at the Ontario Labour Relations Board. Now having moved from public to private sector ADR, she spends her time mediating employment disputes, including disability and wrongful dismissal, as well as human rights disputes. She arbitrates many unjust dismissal claims and other labour grievances.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a lot of collective experience between the two of us,&#8221; she says. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got something like 50 years between us of dispute resolution experience. And that means that I think we hit that sweet spot between being flexible and letting the parties involved dictate the process that works best for them. But we are skilled enough to guide the ship, so to speak, toward an effective resolution.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong><em>Q: </em></strong><em>In legislative terms, are motor vehicle dealerships considered franchises and, as a consequence, how have courts dealt with disputes between vehicle manufacturers and dealers?</em></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>The courts have now fairly clearly established that motor vehicle dealerships—whether representing domestic or foreign manufacturers—are considered franchises under various provinces’ franchise legislation. As such, dealers are entitled to the benefits offered by the legislation.</p>
<p>Traditionally, automotive dealers in North America have operated significant small businesses and been prominent members of local business communities. For many years, those representing North American manufacturers enjoyed the majority of car sales in Canada, while the manufacturers enjoyed the benefits of tariff protection for products imported between Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p>The market changed in the 1970s, when Japanese manufacturers refined their vehicles for the North American market. These gradually became price-competitive, earned high ratings for quality and were largely accepted by consumers. In more recent years, manufacturers based in South Korea, Taiwan and China have competed with their Japanese counterparts and enjoyed similar success, taking a notable share of the Canadian market with low-priced, high-quality vehicles.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a recession that began in 2007 saw the financial demise or restructuring of most North American vehicle manufacturers. This put enormous pressure on dealer relations, leading to a number of highly publicized lawsuits between both individual dealers and dealer groups against the manufacturers. The resulting litigation has explored the nature of the relationship between dealers and manufacturers in considerable detail, particularly with respect to whether or not the relationship constitutes that of a franchise under provincial legislation and how the duty of good faith and fair dealing may apply to the relationship.</p>
<p>In addition, the automotive industry—recognizing the potentially harmful effects and significant costs of legal disputes between manufacturers and dealers, particularly since the vast majority of these disputes would arise during ongoing business relationships—has established a highly effective procedure for addressing such problems through an alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process with specific rules. This is known as the National Automobile Dealer Arbitration Program (NADAP).</p>
<p><strong>Broad definitions</strong></p>
<p>The first hint that automotive dealers would be considered franchisees under provincial legislation came in Ontario in August 1970, when the minister of financial and commercial affairs formed a committee to review and report on, among other things, “all aspects of the relationship between franchisors and franchisees.” The resulting, extensive document, known as the Grange Report, was issued in July 1971 and reviewed common problems in the oil, automotive and fast-food industries. The Grange Report sparked some ongoing interest in the issues it raised, yet for many years afterwards, no provincial governments—except Alberta—took any specific action with regard to franchising.</p>
<p>There was one interesting development in June 1987 in New Brunswick, where the provincial legislature passed a politically driven Motor Vehicle Franchise Act to regulate virtually every aspect of the relationships between motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers. This legislation dealt with such issues as rights to cancel dealerships, compensation formulas on termination, warranty procedures and resales. The legislation was introduced by way of a private member’s bill as one of the last acts of the existing provincial government. In May 1988, the successor government passed legislation to repeal the act in its entirety.</p>
<p>In April 1991, the assistant deputy in the business practices division of Ontario’s ministry of consumer and commercial relations, during an address to a franchising conference, specifically stated any franchise legislation would apply to all types of businesses, saying, “as we all know, franchising is incredibly diverse, ranging from fast food, tax services and cosmetics to car dealers.”</p>
<p>In June 1998, the same Ontario ministry released a consultation paper on franchise disclosure legislation, which made it very clear the new legislation would include three broad forms of franchise arrangements, including product distribution franchises. The white paper, which would eventually lead to the introduction of Ontario’s Arthur Wishart (Franchise Disclosure, 2000) Act, stated these types of arrangements, unlike business format franchises, “allow the franchisee some scope to personalize their business (e.g. “John Smith – Chrysler Scarborough”), with the franchisor generally exerting less control over the format of the franchise. Examples include automotive dealers and soft drink bottlers.”</p>
<p>Now, it is one thing to say a particular form of business arrangement will be included in franchise legislation, but it is another to define a ‘franchise’ broadly enough in the legislation to capture that type of arrangement. The Arthur Wishart Act, like other provinces’ franchise legislation, contains a very complex definition of a franchise, but one part of this definition that creates some controversy regarding its application to motor vehicle dealerships is a requirement for the franchisee “to make a payment or continuing payments, whether direct or indirect, or a commitment to make such payment or payments, to the franchisor in the course of operating the business or as a condition of acquiring the franchise or commencing operations.”</p>
<p>While the other elements of licensed trademarks, control and assistance do fit within the relationship, car dealers typically do not make any payment to manufacturers to acquire a franchise or commence operations. They are certainly required to make continuing payments, direct or indirect, to the manufacturer in the course of operating their business, but unlike business-format franchises, where the nature of these payments is usually in the form of royalties, the payments made by car dealers may be for inventory, fleet financing, parts and supplies, leases, control systems, advertising and promotion or product incentives.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q:</em></strong><em> In legislative terms, are motor vehicle dealerships considered franchises and, as a consequence, how have courts dealt with disputes between vehicle manufacturers and dealers?</em></p>

This is known as the National Automobile Dealer Arbitration Program (NADAP).</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with disputes</strong></p>
<p>A number of legal cases have involved contractual disputes between automotive dealers and manufacturers. To date, no automobile manufacturer has successfully contested the point as to whether or not a dealership constitutes a franchise.</p>
<p>In a 2005 case involving Ford Motor Company of Canada, for example, a new dealer brought a motion for a temporary injunction preventing Ford from terminating a dealership, lease and financial assistance. Ford had refused to approve the dealer’s purchase of an existing dealership because the rate of interest being purchased was 70 per cent as opposed to the allowable 35 per cent. In the court’s view, termination of the agreement before trial would effectively put the dealer out of business, so the court granted the injunction.</p>
<p>Similarly, in a 2007 case involving Toyota Canada, a prospective dealer sought a temporary injunction to restrain Toyota from entering an agreement for a Lexus dealership with another dealer in the downtown Toronto market. The agreement between the parties allowed the prospective dealer to receive reasonable notice before Toyota would proceed. The court held the wording of the agreement was clear and Toyota had complied, so it refused to grant the injunction.</p>
<p>In a 2009 case against Hyundai Auto Canada, a dealer sought an injunction to prevent Hyundai from terminating an agreement. This dealer was part of a group of companies that owned a number of car dealerships. The dealer had given notices in 2005 and 2006 of proposals to purchase another property for a new dealership, but neither of these transactions materialized. Hyundai lost faith in the dealer’s commitment to relocate its dealership and gave notice it would not renew the agreement. The parties entered a provisional settlement, but the dealer subsequently learned Hyundai had contracted for a new site and solicited proposals from other parties. The dealer claimed these actions were in breach of the settlement. The court observed the dealer had presented a serious case to be tried and would suffer irreparable harm if the injunction were not granted. Also, the balance of convenience favoured the dealer. Accordingly, the court granted an interlocutory injunction pending trial.</p>
<p>That same year saw the restructuring of General Motors (GM) of Canada’s operations. The manufacturer proposed to realign its dealership network by terminating certain brands and giving notice to 240 of its 704 dealers that their agreements would not be renewed. GM Canada offered a formula-based payout to these non-renewed dealers if they agreed to an early termination of their agreement and signed a release. These arrangements needed to be completed very quickly to avoid insolvency for GM Canada. Dealers accepting the payout were required to sign a ‘wind-down agreement’ within a very limited period and obtain independent legal advice.</p>
<p><strong><em>Q: </em></strong><em>In legislative terms, are motor vehicle dealerships considered franchises and, as a consequence, how have courts dealt with disputes between vehicle manufacturers and dealers?</em></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>The courts have now fairly clearly established that motor vehicle dealerships—whether representing domestic or foreign manufacturers—are considered franchises under various provinces’ franchise legislation. As such, dealers are entitled to the benefits offered by the legislation.</p>
<p>Traditionally, automotive dealers in North America have operated significant small businesses and been prominent members of local business communities.

This is known as the National Automobile Dealer Arbitration Program (NADAP).</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with Disputes</strong></p>
<p>In a 2010 case, 19 non-renewed dealers who refused the wind-down arrangement commenced an action against GM Canada, claiming the manufacturer had violated its duty of fair dealing and breached its obligations to act in good faith under the <em>Arthur Wishart Act</em>. GM Canada brought a motion to sever these claims and have them heard individually. For purposes of the motion only, GM Canada conceded the dealers were franchisees under the definition of the <em>Arthur Wishart Act</em>.</p>
<p>The dealers argued their claims all contained common and closely related facts, laws and issues in dispute and they did not have the financial resources to litigate on their own. They suggested the need for efficiency and the avoidance of duplication, a multiplicity of actions and potential inconsistent decisions favoured rejection of the motion to sever the actions. The court agreed and allowed the multiple dealer action to proceed. The case was eventually settled.</p>
<p>Then, in 2011, a class action—separate from the multiple dealer action—was commenced in Ontario on behalf of a group of dealers who had accepted the wind-down agreement. Among other claims, it alleged GM Canada had breached the duty of good faith and fair dealing. The court certified the action and allowed it to proceed, stating it was not inconsistent with the purposes of the <em>Arthur Wishart Act</em> to suggest GM Canada had an obligation to disclose all material facts known to it that might reasonably affect the franchisees’ decision to accept the wind-down agreements.</p>
<p>Trial of this action commenced in September 2014, with much media attention. The eventual decision has the potential to represent a landmark case with respect to franchisee relations, the duty of good faith and fair dealing, the duty to disclose, the enforceability of releases and the sanctity of a contract. The potential damages to be claimed are in the hundreds of millions of dollars.</p>
<p><strong>Continued costs</strong></p>
<p>No doubt franchising activity will continue between automobile manufacturers and dealers as their agreements become more precise, investments become more costly and dealers become more aware of their legal options. Canada’s legal landscape is markedly different from that of the U.S., where state governments enacted separate and distinct automotive dealer legislation years ago, outside of conventional business-format legislation.</p>

<p>Jun 6, 2019</p>
<p>As indicated in <em><a href="https://adrchambers.com/news-articles/commentary/the-value-of-mentorship-part-1-reflections-on-my-journey-from-iam-mentee-to-iam-fellow/">The Value of Mentorship, Part 1: Reflections on My Journey from IAM Mentee to IAM Fellow</a> </em>, IAM mentorship has been the defining professional experience in Alicia’s path to becoming a successful professional mediator. Her experience shows that the IAM’s mentorship program can be more than it is today, for it is underutilized and its potential untapped. If the program is intentionally invested in and monitored, it can provide unexpected professional and personal benefits to both mentors and mentees. Importantly, it will provide IAM members with a direct opportunity to identify, coach, and develop the next generation of professionals who are well educated, diverse and highly skilled.</p>
<p>A robust mentorship program will ensure that the IAM continues to be the international gathering place for highly skilled and ethically focused dispute resolution professionals. Solid initial steps for the mentorship program to remain relevant and the IAM to best position itself for continued international leadership, include enhancing the visibility of the IAM mentorship program and challenging IAM members to cultivate mentorships with the upcoming generation of professional mediators.</p>
<p><strong>The Next Generation. </strong>Over the last ten years, we have seen a steady increase in the discourse of mediation as well as a rise in dispute resolution programs and certifications. As a result, a new generation of mediators between the ages of 25-45 is emerging onto the scene. Some of these mediators come from civil law practice, yet most have ADR-related undergraduate and</p>
<p>graduate degrees, specialized areas of training, and unique experience that have allowed them to put theory into practice.</p>
<p>Fine-tuned training programs have equipped a new generation of mediators with a holistic approach to dispute resolution, an approach that considers culture, gender, identity, human rights, technology, neuroscience, mental health, and design. This new generation is eager to learn about the field from seasoned professionals such as IAM members who bring years of legal and non-legal experience to their practices, and who have done incredible work founding renowned groups and organizations, such as the IAM, that create opportunities for networking and professional development. Without a doubt, IAM members have succeeded in bringing credibility to a field that they helped create.</p>
<p>Less experienced practitioners tend to enter the field of dispute resolution with unique, fresh and important perspectives around today’s issues. The IAM mentorship program can provide these less experienced practitioners with guidance and encouragement to build their practices and tackle the nuanced challenges and ethical dilemmas encountered in dispute resolution work.</p>
<p><strong>The Benefits to the IAM. </strong>At IAM conferences and in conversations among ourselves, we focus on expanding our toolboxes and adding lenses through which we can view and analyze dispute resolution. The mentorship program and inviting guests to our conferences are two avenues for the IAM to challenge current viewpoints and understandings and reveal an openness to rise and meet today’s local and global challenges. Mentorship is a reciprocal relationship where practitioners at different places in their careers learn from one another’s experience. Passions for the craft interact and allow mentor and mentee to strengthen their approaches and challenge underlying assumptions about dispute resolution.</p>
<p>The mentorship program benefits mentors personally and the IAM as a whole. The IAM benefits by cultivating new members who will help shape the future of the organization, encouraging membership beyond North America as mentees are identified in Europe, Africa, Asia, South America, and Australia, and by learning from the unique and fresh perspectives that mentees bring with them. The next generation of mediators is diverse, and the IAM mentorship program can be a fluid platform to honor and encourage that diversity. The IAM will be shaping a future membership that will range in age, gender, race and culture.</p>
<p>The direct benefits to the IAM mentors include opportunities to learn different approaches to conversations and perspectives, including a deeper understanding of the dynamics of conflict as they relate to structural injustices, power imbalances and barriers to inclusivity experienced today no matter the geographic location. We know that some of the cultural and racial issues today – and the power with which they are felt and lived – are not new. However, the intensity and speed with which communication spreads information, fear, and threats, allow these issues to feel new, forceful, and emotionally raw, and the mentor and mentee can learn from and support each other.</p>
<p>To maximize the reciprocal learning relationship, mentors can seek talented less experienced mediators who are from a different generation, gender, race, culture or ability than their own. They can both teach and learn in a co-mediation environment, from co-publications and from inviting mentees to speak on panels about their experience and perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Summary and Call to Action.</strong> In the age of the entrepreneur, mediators have alternatives for organizations to support, conferences to attend and memberships with which to connect. As we well know, a person can only do so much, and there are plentiful options for the next generation of professional mediators. The IAM mentorship program provides an avenue for continued learning from one another and an opportunity to grow and diversify membership that adheres to the highest practice and ethical qualifications, which sets the IAM apart from other organizations. Incoming IAM President Chuck Doran has noted that building the mentorship program will be emphasized by IAM in order to support the next generation of mediators by tapping the vast wellspring of experience in our membership that needs to be shared.</p>

<p>May 23, 2019</p>
<p>At the 2013 IAM Conference in Toronto, the IAM launched a mentorship program and inducted me as one of the organization’s first mentees. This was a pivotal moment in my mediation career, and I want to share with you why.</p>
<p>As a young mediator, this conference exposed me to mediation greatness. I recall being introduced to presenters such as past IAM President Eric Galton, ADR Chambers President Allan Stitt, Dr. Izzeldin Abuelaish, Hon. Joe Clark, Hon. George Adams, former UN Deputy Secretary-General Louise Frechette, Ambassador Ken Taylor, and former Grande Council Chief John Beaucage (with whom I now co-mediate).</p>
<p>Strategically, I sat at a table with several of the speakers and a mediator I later came to know as Lee Jay Berman. Near the end of the conference, I quietly muttered to Lee Jay how impressed I was by all of the experience in the room. Without hesitation, he looked at me and replied ‘<em>The feeling is mutual’</em>.</p>
<p>This is the value of IAM mentorship. The IAM is a welcoming, supportive and encouraging community of practitioners who are dedicated to professional development, peer-to-peer knowledge exchange and advancing the field of mediation. Importantly, this means that members of the organization have the capacity to empower, enhance and shape the skills of up-and-coming mediators.</p>
<p>All our members have the opportunity to support up-and-coming mediators who show passion, determination and promise in the field. We owe it to the profession to share our knowledge and skills with others. Finally, we owe it to ourselves to learn from different perspectives and experiences, because mentees have a fresh perspective and drive that can push us out of our comfort zones and challenge our normative assumptions.</p>
<p>I was first introduced to the IAM through my mentor Paul Iacono. In 2007, I sent Paul an e-mail with all the wisdom of a second-year university student. Not only did Paul respond and meet with me, he immediately invited me to begin shadowing him. I recently asked Paul why he took a chance on such a young practitioner and he responded:</p>
<p>“My initial impression of Alicia was that for someone so young she had great insight, particularly when it came to reading people and generating creative solutions that solve problems. I knew immediately that she was very empathetic and that is something you cannot teach, but it is an essential ingredient required of a good mediator. She has an ability to connect effortlessly with people from different backgrounds, experiences and cultures. I had no hesitation in taking her on as a mentee. I knew that someday she would be a valuable addition to our organization and in fact, someone who could take over for me”.</p>
<p>Under Paul’s guidance, I spent the following six years shadowing him on over one hundred mediations, took ADR certificate courses, completed a Master’s degree in ADR, worked on an international negotiation case and worked with the UN.</p>
<p>Paul was already my mentor, but in 2013 the IAM’s mentorship program made it a formal relationship whereby professional goals would be set, and both Paul and I would be held accountable for reaching those goals. My professional goals on the application included completing an LL.M. in ADR, increasing my number of paid cases, presenting at conferences and publishing articles. These goals were met with the unwavering support from both Paul and IAM members located in Toronto, such as IAM co-founder Cliff Hendler. The mentorship program connected me with other mediators of Paul’s and Cliff’s caliber, thus my opportunities for growth and learning increased exponentially.</p>
<p>Paul continued to invest in my development by introducing me to seminal courses and programs in the field, facilitating meetings with notable practitioners and inviting me to events and conferences. Paul not only taught me everything he knew about dispute resolution, but he also instilled in me the value of authentic networking, humility, patience and hard work. Paul genuinely wanted to see me thrive.</p>
<p>Something that is often overlooked regarding mentorship is how the mentor benefits from the mentee. According to Paul, “mentorship is a two-way street; you get back what you put in. Alicia is a great listener and she reads body language very well, and my own skills in that regard have improved. She has taught me about conflict resiliency; the idea that you as the mediator must stay optimistic, regulate your own emotions and physiological responses and trust that navigating the dynamics of conflict will lead to a resolution. When we co-mediate we can read each other’s minds. We have complete trust in each other’s solutions. All of the time and effort has been rewarding and I now have a professional colleague who has become a valuable sounding board, as well as a good friend”.</p>
<p>Both the IAM and Paul invested in me and inspired me to be the best practitioner I could be. In return, I wanted to invest my energy and passion into the IAM. As a mentee, I attended conferences and worked on the planning committee for the annual joint Winkler/IAM/Osgoode conference. In addition, I actively supported the development and formalization of the IAM’s Junto program and facilitated the program for several years.</p>
<p>Upon achieving my goals and increasing my mediation practice, I was accepted as a Fellow of the IAM in 2017. My investment in the organization continues, as I am now a member of the Mentorship Committee, co-facilitated a session in Edinburgh and published an article with Ben Picker on <em>The Words We Use as Mediators</em>, attended a board meeting in Zurich to speak to the importance of increasing the IAM’s mentorship program and diversifying our membership regarding age, gender and culture. More recently, I have been supporting Claude Amar’s vision of creating the World-Wide Mediation Mentorship Program and I be will co-facilitating a session in Banff with Thierry Garby on ‘Mediation in 2025’.</p>
<p>My journey from IAM Mentee to Fellow is the result of Paul Iacono responding to an e-mail sent to him by a passionate university student who wanted to learn more about the field of mediation. It is the result of being invited to the 2013 Toronto conference where my learning was shaped by exceptional practitioners and where my own experience was acknowledged and valued. It is also the result of the members of the IAM actively believing in, and investing in, me. While illustrative of what is possible, each mentorship will certainly be unique, based on the capabilities and needs of the individuals involved.</p>
<p>Paul and I believe in supporting the IAM’s mentorship program, and we hope that our mentorship, which has transformed into a meaningful professional collaboration and rich friendship, convinces you to do the same.</p>

<p><em>Q: How can franchisors and franchisees work together to forge good franchise relationships and avoid litigation?</em></p>
<p>A: This is a simple question that demands a fairly detailed answer. One key principle to keep in mind is it is up to both parties—i.e. the franchisor and the franchisee—to work together to establish and maintain a good, friendly working relationship. That said, the franchisor must take the lead, by setting up system-wide programs to help further such relationships.</p>
<p>Another key principle is good communication, which is fundamental to maintaining good franchise relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Enabling positive communications<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Successful franchise systems are built on trust and solid relationships. There will always be variations in terms of individual franchisees’ performance and expectations. Experience has shown a lack of trust between a franchisor and its franchisees will arise in times of stress or upset.</p>
<p>Before getting to that point, then, it is important to explore how these parties will communicate and solidify their relationships. Communications can take many forms, but they need to be initiated at the outset and then on an ongoing basis by a proactive franchisor, whether through newsletters, e-mail blasts, a password-controlled intranet, peer review boards, franchise advisory councils (FACs), ‘town hall’ meetings, conferences, franchise conventions, independent ombudsman programs, a CEO’s private hotline, controlled social media, field representative visits, performance reviews, training sessions and/or an online operations manual.</p>
<p>Progressive franchisors should also know how important it is to listen to their franchisees. They should encourage them to make suggestions and then, in turn, respond to those suggestions quickly and respectfully.</p>
<p>Franchisees, meanwhile, will appreciate learning about improvements that are being made to their franchise system as a direct result of their suggestions. Many franchisors have even established reward programs to recognize those franchisees whose suggestions are adopted as part of the franchise system. Others establish incentive programs, such as paid vacations, for franchisees who reach and exceed any performance targets that have been established by both parties.</p>
<p>Similarly, franchisors should also react professionally and in a timely manner to their franchisees’ complaints. Indeed, franchisees should be actively encouraged to voice their concerns and, if possible, to suggest practical and reasonable remedies to the problems they have identified.</p>
<p>Timely and informative communications coming from the franchisor can help to allay fears and build trust. Keeping franchisees informed early and frequently about important changes and milestones—including management appointments, succession plans, new competitors, franchise openings, market research into consumer preferences, industry regulations, updates to system standards, individual franchisees’ successes, technology enhancements, graphic standards for marketing and advertising, crisis management programs and social media initiatives—can prevent suspicion and rumours among them.</p>
<p><strong>Avoiding dispute litigation<br />
</strong>For many reasons, franchise disputes are on the rise today. With franchise legislation having been enacted in six of Canada’s provinces, giving important legal rights to franchisees, and increased publicity through conventional and social media, franchisees are now much more aware of their rights—and growing numbers of lawyers have become more active in representing them in disputes.</p>
<p>Conflicts between franchisee and franchisor can arise for a variety of reasons, including unprofitability at the franchise level, uncontrolled franchise system growth, changing market conditions, new competition, inconsistent treatment of franchisees and failure of the franchisor to disclose material information.</p>
<p>With those reasons in mind, the question is how can both parties avoid conflict and resolve their disagreements or disputes without resorting to litigation. For a prospective franchisee, this is a matter of knowing what to look for and learn when considering whether or not to buy a particular franchise. For the franchisor, on the other hand, it is a matter of implementing programs across the system to help minimize disputes at an early stage.</p>
<p>Indeed, early dispute resolution programs offer quicker solutions to significant problems at a low cost, help maintain franchise business relationships, minimize disruption, do not require lawyers and can support long-term success.</p>
<p>By way of example, while it is still not commonly used, franchisors should consider adding a simple provision to their franchise agreements that calls for disputes to be negotiated. Such provisions involve a preliminary level of negotiation within a short time frame. Then, if that process does not result in a satisfactory resolution, it is followed by a second level, involving senior management.</p>
<p>These negotiations are confidential, but conducted without prejudice to either party if no resolution is achieved. Rather, when negotiations do not result in an agreement, another method of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is invoked, such as third-party mediation.</p>
<p>Indeed, given the possibility that internal programs will not result in the resolution of disagreements and disputes, proactive franchisors should also consider external programs. In addition to mediation, such options include arbitration, which is a more formal type of ADR that results in a binding decision, or working with an independent franchise system ombudsman.</p>
<p>Another useful program for early dispute resolution is, as previously mentioned, the implementation of a new CEO hotline. Leadership, after all, needs to come from the top level of management.</p>
<p>In some cases, the hotline is not a telephone number, but an e-mail address. Either way, it is set up to allow franchisees to contact their franchisor’s CEO on a confidential basis, with no possible repercussions, and then receive a quick and meaningful response. Indeed, systemic changes have been introduced to franchise systems directly as a result of this form of communication.</p>
<p>A franchise advisory council (FAC) should meet regularly to discuss a wide variety of issues.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Franchisees working together<br />
</strong></p>
<p>Some franchise systems get their franchisees involved in mentorship programs. In these situations, a new franchisee is partnered with an experienced franchisee who can help answer questions, explain various procedures and operations and clear up any potential misunderstandings.</p>
<p>A few well-established franchise systems have now established peer groups and peer review panels that work to resolve disputes, particularly those between fellow franchisees. Such a program requires formalized rules and procedures, including those regarding the composition of the panel, and must be endorsed and promoted by the franchisor’s management team. These details may be published in the operations manual, the franchise agreement or, alternatively, an ancillary document.</p>
<p>All hearings before a peer review panel will need to be kept confidential, but generic findings can then be made available to the franchisee community. One of the key factors for these programs is whether or not the review process can result in (a) a binding decision or (b) a recommendation for further, timely consideration by the senior management team.</p>
<p>Another mechanism, as mentioned earlier, is a FAC. Most franchise systems should establish some form of FAC, but only when the time is right. While it is difficult to generalize about such timing, key factors include the maturity of the system in terms of years in operation and the total number of franchises.</p>
<p>A properly established FAC will comprise a fair balance of franchisor representatives and franchisees, working within a well-defined set of rules and procedures. This group can deal with a wide variety of issues, but it must always be supported by the franchisor and the franchisee community if it is going to have any credibility.</p>
<p>Meetings should be held regularly. For larger franchise systems, it might be necessary to set up regional FACs, rather than just a central one.  Minutes of the meetings and any decisions that will affect all franchisees should be made available regularly across the system.</p>
<p><strong>Shared interests<br />
</strong></p>
<p>When considering any of the above options, it is key for both franchisors and franchisees to keep in mind that being able to resolve their disagreements to their satisfaction has become the hallmark of successful franchise systems. It is in both of their interests to work together.</p>

<p><strong>PREFACE</strong></p>
<p>This article introduces a new dispute resolution process that we have termed a Hybrid Process, which has been designed to support nation-to-nation building in Canada. It is clear that classic theories and current mediation practices are not suited to conflicts that involve Indigenous peoples. In the past, we have used conventional mediation processes with First Nation People and it has not worked because mediation is not an Indigenous cultural practice. When conventional mediation has been employed, First Nation People have often not been participatory and have understandably withdrawn from the process. However, the mediation process is both malleable and adaptable, and the Hybrid Process is built on those solid foundations. A Hybrid Process refers to a combination of two culturally unique practices – Indigenous peacemaking[1] and mediation.[2] The combination of these two practices provides a culturally sensitive and holistic approach to conflict and nation building.</p>
<p>This process has been designed for multi-party conflicts involving Indigenous leaders, communities, governments and stakeholders. Due to the complex nature of Indigenous relations in Canada, this process utilizes a team of culturally fluent practitioners to facilitate the process. Designed by a First Nations leader and former Grand Council Chief and two Canadian mediators, this process introduces a new perspective to resolving disputes in a changing landscape and incorporates what we have learned over many years and thousands of mediations.</p>
<p><strong>A HYBRID PROCESS</strong></p>
<p>A Hybrid Process to nation building was inspired by the concept of <em>Anishnabe N’oon Da Gaaziiwin<strong>[3]</strong></em>, which translates to “listening to the voice of the people.” This concept was born from our intention to decolonize the use of mediation to resolve Indigenous-settler disputes by advocating for the inclusion of Indigenous voices and expertise. In addition, we recognized the added value of having a diverse team of practitioners facilitate complex disputes. A team approach allows for multiple lenses, experiences and expertise to support both the parties and the resolution process. Before discussing the benefits of a team approach and the peacemaking-mediation nexus, we will emphasize why a Hybrid Process to nation-building is relevant in Canada’s current cultural and legal landscape.</p>
<p>The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRIP), recognizes and reaffirms the rights of Indigenous peoples to protect their identities, cultures, and lands.[4] The declaration speaks to the importance of Indigenous people having access to dispute resolution processes that understand their culture and legal customs. Canada’s Truth and Reconciliation Commissions Calls to Action 24, 27, 28, 57, and 92 call for cultural competency and conflict resolution skills-based training.[5] For these reasons, the role of a facilitator is strengthened when they identify as Indigenous and/or have cultural competency training on the history of Indigenous Peoples. Considering Canada’s changing legal landscape, Indigenous rights must be at the forefront of dispute resolution processes, and the facilitators need to recognize those rights and honour traditional Indigenous values and cultural mores.</p>
<p>Canada’s adoption of UNDRIP shines light on the legal importance of Indigenous treaty rights, which are recognized in Section 35 of the <em>Constitution Act,</em> and have a basis in common law which goes back to the Royal Proclamation of 1763.[6] Canada’s legal landscape began to change in the 1990’s with the <em>Sparrow </em>and <em>Van der Peet </em>cases, which asserted that Indigenous rights stem from pre-European contact and are integral to preserving pre-contact culture. In 1997, the <em>Delgamuukw </em>case introduced aboriginal title to the legal landscape and importantly, the 2004 <em>Haida/Takuu </em>decision brought aboriginal title and the duty to consult to the forefront of discussions on land rights. This was followed by establishing the threshold for consultation in the <em>Mikisew Cree </em>decision of 2005.[7] As a result of aboriginal title not being absolute in Canada[8], differing perspectives on land use are forced to be reconciled. With conflicting perspectives at play and two different legal systems (spiritual Indigenous laws and Canadian law), the use of a Hybrid Process can support the merging of opposing interests.[9] First Nations people are not used to the adversarial court system and how a lawyer might portray evidence in a courtroom. The Hybrid Process has room to explore both common law provisions and First Nations Natural Justice in order to approach values and decision making in a fair way.</p>
<p>While not every case is ripe for dispute resolution, it is in the best interest for the majority of parties to a conflict to avoid the courtroom. Cases involving rights (such as treaty rights) that might have an effect on common law deserve and need to go through a court process. Interest-based cases, such as commercial, social, cultural and environmental disputes deserve a resolution process that is culturally appropriate. A Hybrid Process that combines Indigenous peacemaking and mediation provides parties the opportunity to reconcile different understandings and interpretations of the law and rights. Multiparty conflicts in Canada include disputes over land, water, resources, governance, culture, identity, and citizenship. A Hybrid Process can support these conflicts using a team of trained facilitators who specialize in fostering the dialogue that is required to broaden perspectives and bridge understandings.</p>
<p><strong>A TEAM OF FACILITATORS</strong></p>
<p>A core principle of this process is the use of a team of facilitators. These multiparty disputes can involve dozens of people in an intractable conflict, requiring more than one expert practitioner to facilitate month or year-long processes. The disputes deal with issues pertaining to culture, diversity, power, emotions, history, and gender. These issues are deeply rooted in the lived experience and history of Indigenous peoples, communities, groups and the nation. A team approach allows the facilitators to support one another while facilitating the dynamics of a given dispute, and to collaboratively conduct research, prepare timelines, plan the process, travel together, and debrief. The team of facilitators’ collective skills analyze the dynamics through multiple lenses, filter the information being presented, and navigate the resolution process.</p>
<p>To successfully navigate the dynamics of conflict, the team of facilitators must have complimentary mediation training and experience. As an example, our team is comprised of practitioners who possess advanced dispute resolution training. As a team, we are experts in tactical communication, negotiation skills, mediation theory and practice, law, process design, restorative justice, emotional intelligence, and cross-cultural dispute resolution. Combined, we have worked on complex national and international cases that have involved governments, revolutionary movements, stakeholders, environmental groups, and Indigenous communities. In addition to mediation training and experience, we have found that a team of facilitators needs a third ingredient for successful cultural fluency.</p>
<p>A Hybrid Process to support nation-to-nation building requires the team of facilitators to possess cultural fluency in order to support parties in bridging the cultural gap. Cultural fluency refers to the ability to recognize that inter-cultural conflict stems from differences in norms and worldviews. A culturally fluent practitioner is able to help intractable parties understand and articulate their perspectives.[10] Facilitators who have a personal connection and/or understanding of those norms and worldviews can assist in engaging the parties in seeing the conflict from the perspective of the other. In regards to the Hybrid Process, being culturally fluent means having Indigenous facilitators and mediators who understand the historical narrative and cultural nuances of Indigenous peoples in Canada.</p>
<p>Indigenous peoples in Canada have resolved conflicts for thousands of years using traditional peacemaking processes. These processes vary across Indigenous cultures but find commonality in their use of spiritual laws, traditional medicines, ceremonies, teachings, songs, and circle processes. Circles are a traditional form of gathering and can be used for sharing, healing, decision-making or restorative justice. Circles create an immediate balance of power amongst participants as you can only speak when holding the talking stick and therefore, are discouraged from interrupting. In addition, it keeps a hierarchy from being formed and invokes empathy by encouraging openness and honesty. The prayer that is done during the circle calls on the Creator to listen to the truth of the words that are being spoken and for the participants to show respect for those truths. Circles are facilitated by an experienced circle keeper—an elder, Chief, healer, or respected member of the community. When facilitating a Hybrid Process, we use two circle keepers due to the complexity of the disputes. The male former Grand Council Chief leads the ceremony and puts forward the questions, while the female non-Indigenous conflict analyst is responsible for closing the circle by summarizing the voices of the participants. The balance of having a male and female facilitator present is part of an Indigenous teaching on building community. This also creates a cultural balance when working with Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups.</p>
<p>The synergy between the facilitators is fundamental to the resolution process. Our team approach uses a male Indigenous facilitator and female non-Indigenous facilitator. Their unique knowledge and skills work together harmoniously to foster a balanced and holistic process. It also follows a traditional concept that is inclusive of the male and female element in community-building. In addition to having synergy, both facilitators need to be respected by the communities and viewed as culturally fluent and experienced practitioners. They need to possess an in-depth understanding of the dispute at hand, legal knowledge relevant to the issues, and a complimentary skill-set. These qualities combined allow for the successful facilitation of a Hybrid Process.</p>
<p><strong>THE PEACEMAKING-MEDIATION NEXUS</strong></p>
<p>A Hybrid Process to nation-to-nation building combines various facets of traditional peacekeeping and mediation. As a result of multiparty conflicts having unique dynamics and needs, we begin each Hybrid Process with information gathering sessions and community meetings. Information gathering involves a series of conference calls, meetings, and group observations. This process allows the facilitators to learn about the key issues, concerns and interests of the groups, while gaining an understanding of the dynamics at play. Our team has found that observing group dynamics prior to commencing the facilitation process, allows you to analyze body language, eye contact, gestures, and hear the direct conversations that take place between disputants. This information helps prepare the team for the community meetings.</p>
<p>If there are multiple communities involved in the process, community meetings held in each of the com- munities may be needed in order to better understand the needs of their members. We aim to spend the same amount of time in each community, allocating half a day for each meeting. Indigenous communities are collectivist, meaning Chiefs and council take direction from their membership. As a result of Indigenous communities having their own unique cultures and customs, even though they may belong to a larger collective, it is important that each process is guided by the voices of the community. The information that we garner during these meetings pertains to their history, relations, cultural practices, interests, immediate and long-term goals, personalities and communication styles. Our facilitation team has found that the community meetings strongly influence the design of the Hybrid Process, as it allows for the ability to narrow down the areas of focus, questions and caucus groups. The meetings are held in circle format and structured informally.</p>
<p>The formal process commences with four rounds of confidential sharing circles with the parties. Each round focuses on a question that the facilitators have designed specifically to bring out the needs and interests of the group.[11] Depending on the number of parties involved, each round may take a full day in order for everyone to have the time needed to answer the question. Prior to the questions being asked, there is a prayer, introduction and smudging ceremony.[12]</p>
<p>A brush-off ceremony is conducted following the smudge. After cleansing their body, the participant will turn around and allow the circle keeper to remove any negative energy or baggage by brushing an eagle feather across their shoulders. This is done with the intent to release any prejudices that may have been brought to the process. It is both a symbolic and spiritual way of getting rid of any negative feelings.</p>
<p>When everyone in the circle has had the opportunity to hold the talking stick and have their perspective heard, the second facilitator summarizes the voices and the process ends with a closing prayer. Our facilitation team has found that the sharing circles often end up being healing circles, as parties use their time when holding the talking stick to speak openly and honestly to release emotions. It is the combination of the circle, prayer, ceremonies and talking stick that creates a safe and trusted space for parties to share their perspectives. The circle process helps the parties to build rapport and trust with one another and the facilitators, which creates a ripe environment to integrate the steps from a mediation process.</p>
<p>When each circle participant has answered the four questions that the facilitators have posed to the group we move on to the next stage, caucusing. All of the information that has been shared during the circles allows the facilitators to design caucus groups and topics of focus. One caucus group may include community representatives that need to narrow down their interests. Another may be a group that has further emotional needs or concerns that need to be voiced. At times, we may have to bring together high-conflict individuals whose tension with one another needs to be addressed. The facilitators may choose to meet with several groups in a day or just one, as this de- pends on the size of the group and discussion topic. The caucus groups are often changed around in order to begin integrating perspectives and broadening the conversation. Once all of the issues and areas of interest have been discussed at length, everyone is brought together for a joint brainstorming session on moving forward. If needed, the facilitators may transition back into caucusing if certain options need to be explored further with the parties. This back and forth between joint sessions and caucuses takes place until a resolution is reached.</p>
<p>It is the facilitation teams’ responsibility to ensure that the parties have ownership over the resolution, as it will impact the parties and their communities. In order to achieve this, we ask the parties to write out the resolution collectively, which can take more than a day. This is done to ensure that the agreement will include language that the parties and their community members will respect, and therefore feel accountable too. The agreement will be signed by the parties but will still have to go back to the community for approval via a vote. ?hen a final agreement is reached a closing circle process is held and a pipe ceremony takes place. Our team’s Indigenous facilitator is a pipe carrier, so he arranges his medicine bundle, does a smudging ceremony, offers a prayer, and guides the pipe around the circle to finalize the resolution.</p>
<p><strong>NATION-TO-NATION BUILDING</strong></p>
<p>There are many unique factors that come into play when facilitating a Hybrid Process that supports nation-to-nation building. For example, the concept of time is something that needs to be balanced between the expectations of Indigenous and non-Indigenous groups (such as corporations or governments). To guide the differing perspectives amongst the people and groups, strategic seating arrangements for the circle processes may need to be designed beforehand (this can help create a power balance), and; depending on who the parties are, different dispute resolution practitioners may need to be brought in for support. For example, if government is involved we may bring in a facilitator who has worked in politics. These factors and more require critical conflict analysis skills, thorough planning, and thoughtful reflection in order to coordinate all of the moving parts.</p>
<p>When facilitated by a team of experienced culturally fluent practitioners, the Hybrid Process provides communities and groups with the resources needed to develop effective lines of communication that support relationship building. We attribute this to the combination of Indigenous peacemaking with mediation, which allows all parties to take part in a process that unites effective elements from each culture’s dispute resolution practices. The unity of two culturally unique practices sets the tone for bridging perceptions and merging interests, which has proven successful in paving the way for a more viable future of Nation-to-Nation relationship building in Canada.</p>
