										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Have a Plan</h3>
<p>If you are worried about starting a difficult conversation, sit down and consider your goals in the conversation. Then write out an agenda for how you would like the conversation to go, and a script for how you can best start the conversation to achieve your goals and move into that agenda, recognizing that you might not be able to control how they respond.</p>
<h3>Emotions are part of who you are</h3>
<p>When you keep your emotions out of a relationship, you keep a significant part of yourself out of the relationship. If you don’t tell someone when you have been hurt or upset by their behaviour, how can that person know to change their behaviour so as not to hurt your feelings or make you angry in the future? If you pretend that everything is fine, the other person is not getting accurate feedback about the impact of their behaviour on you.</p>
<h3>Don’t Confuse Judgments for Feelings</h3>
<p>We often think we are sharing our feelings when we are sharing judgments. Saying to someone that they are selfish is not a feeling, it is a judgment. The feeling is that you are being overlooked or under-appreciated, etc.</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t Vent – Describe Your Feelings Carefully</h3>
<p>Too often we confuse being emotional with expressing emotions clearly. Acknowledge their emotions and yours. Seek to understand the emotions. Express the full spectrum of your feelings, not just the surface emotion (which might seem to be anger, for example). Sometimes it is also easier and more productive to have this discussion when you are not both in the grip of the emotions (i.e., the next morning, or an hour later).</p>
<h3>Negotiator, Know Thyself</h3>
<p>It is important to become aware of your identity issues (related to your values or your self-image) so that you can be aware of how they might be triggered. If you find yourself reacting negatively in a conversation, ask yourself whether there are identity issues at play.</p>
<h3>Frame Your Feedback</h3>
<p>When giving feedback, particularly feedback that you think may upset the other person, it may be important to help the other person maintain a balanced sense of themselves. That is, you may want to make an effort to embed your immediate feedback in the larger context of who they are as a person.  For example: &#8220;I know you are a very conscientious person who pays a lot of attention to detail in your reports. With respect to this latest report, I would ask that you make the following changes&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<h3>Don’t Blame Others – Unless You Need To</h3>
<p>Determine whether your primary goal in exploring the past is to lay blame and prescribe a punishment or to develop understanding and improve the situation in the future. If your goal is to develop understanding, it is important to try to put aside the need to be right. Instead, focus your energies, and those of the other person, on identifying all of the factors that contributed to the present situation.</p>
<h3>Establish a Shared Reality</h3>
<p>Build a shared pool of facts before leaping into the deep end of warring conclusions.</p>
<h3>Separate Actions from Intent</h3>
<p>Separate the impact of a person’s actions from their intent. We often assume negative intent on their part if the impact is negative to us. If we clarify their intent, we may feel better about them and the situation if we conclude that their intentions were good. Similarly, where we have caused harm, clarifying our intentions to the other person may help them see us more positively than their initial reaction might have suggested.</p>
<h3>Choose an Appropriate Time to Respond</h3>
<p>If you are caught in a difficult conversation by surprise, remember that you may not control what the other person wants or needs to say, but you can control your own response. You can divide a challenging conversation into two parts. Listen and understand their views/issues. Respond later, after giving yourself time to digest and consider your response. If making it a two-part conversation, explain to the other party that you want to give them a full and proper response, and that it would be better for everyone if you took the time to consider it fully.</p>
<h3>Converse with Purpose</h3>
<p>In any difficult conversation, your first question to yourself should be, “What is my purpose?” Everything you say and do in that conversation should be guided by and consistent with that purpose. If I want my boss to like me and to promote me, proving my boss wrong with spectacularly good facts may be impressive, but it is a poor way to achieve that goal.</p>
<h3>If it IS Broke, Fix it!</h3>
<p>If what you are trying when dealing with a challenging person is not working, try something else. Don’t keep beating your head against a wall. Reframe the conversation into a more productive direction. If discussing ideas is turning into an aggressive debate, focus back on the underlying goals of each party. You can more productively work back to ideas later. If having a discussion in public is getting tense, you might take it into a private one-on-one setting.</p>
<h3>Try Understanding</h3>
<p>Before you respond to difficult behaviour by another person, try to understand why they are acting that way. With that analysis in mind, you will be much more effective in thinking about how to respond. If you think they are lying because they were caught unprepared by your questions and didn’t want to look stupid, you might be able to get the truth out by adjourning and giving them time to revisit their answers later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Power</h3>
<p>Power is an interesting concept as it relates to negotiation. We all have a sense of what power is, but usually from examples we can think of rather than because we know the definition. In fact, if asked for a definition of power in negotiation, we probably struggle, and prefer to just give examples of who has power and who does not.</p>
<p>The reason is that we use the word ‘power’ in negotiation to mean a number of different things. For example, some people think of power in terms of the repercussions of walking away from the table and not reaching a deal. If you perceive that not reaching a deal is bad for you and really good for the other side, you’ll feel like they have all the power. And vice versa.</p>
<p>Others perceive power in terms of how persuasive someone is in a negotiation. A ‘powerful negotiator’ is someone who has the skills, technique and confidence to persuade people who don’t want to be persuaded.</p>
<p>Both are forms of power; the first is ‘substantive’ power and the second is ‘process’ power. The one you have more control over, of course, is process power and the best way to become a powerful negotiator is to learn effective negotiation techniques and improve your ability to persuade.</p>
<h3>Standards of Legitimacy</h3>
<p>No one wants to be taken advantage of in a negotiation. So what can you do to protect yourself? How can you persuade the other side that they are not being taken? The answer to both questions is the same: use standards of legitimacy. That is, look for objective criteria, benchmarks, standards of fairness that were not created by the parties in the negotiation.</p>
<p>If someone makes you an offer, ask them for supporting facts as to why it’s fair. That way you protect yourself.</p>
<p>If you’re making an offer, ensure that you have an external standard that supports your position. This way you will be able to explain why your offer is objectively fair and not simply something that you want. Using an objective standard is far more persuasive than just arguing for what we want.</p>
<h3>Threats</h3>
<p>Sometimes the other negotiator is behaving in such a way that a deal may not be reached. It may be tempting to threaten them with what is going to happen if you don’t reach a deal. Threats, however, are rarely helpful. If threatened, the other negotiator may counter with a threat of their own. At a minimum, their back will be up.</p>
<p>In a negotiation, there is an important distinction between making a threat and enabling the other side to realize the consequences of not reaching agreement. Threatening will just get their back up, whereas calmly discussing the consequences of a failed negotiation may help them to reflect and adjust their stance. Suggesting that the result of not reaching a deal would be bad for you as well as for them is one way to get your point across without it landing as a threat.</p>
<h3>Expanding the Pie</h3>
<p>A lot of people talk about expanding the pie in negotiation, yet not everyone knows what this means. Expanding the pie means finding ways to create value in a negotiation that may not be initially apparent. It is a reminder that before we divide the pie, we should try to make the pie as big as possible.</p>
<p>Expanding the pie usually starts with exploring the interests of both sides. Once we learn both sides’ interests, we can look for creative ways to meet those interests by brainstorming options. If we can make one side or both sides better off than when they started, the pie has been expanded.</p>
<h3>Partisan Assumptions</h3>
<p>We all think we’re fair, but we’re all in danger of believing our own partisan perceptions. We think we know what others are thinking and how they’ll act and we convince ourselves that what we see is consistent with our view. If we see them as the enemy and treat them that way, we likely find ourselves in a fight. The best negotiators are careful about not making partisan assumptions and trying to see what the other person is really saying and doing.</p>
<h3>Disclosing Information</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it’s hard to get people to disclose information in a negotiation. They may fear that they’ll disclose something they shouldn’t and you’ll take advantage of them, so they err on the side of disclosing too little. How do you deal with someone who keeps everything close to the vest and won’t disclose anything?</p>
<p>Try modeling the behaviour you want them to exhibit by taking the lead and disclosing some information. If they see you sharing information, they may be more willing to reciprocate and disclose some information about themselves. They need to see you as a person who won’t take advantage of their disclosure. One way to do that is for you to take the lead and disclose information.</p>
<h3>Emotional Negotiators</h3>
<p>Some people get very emotional when they negotiate. They may do so as a tactic or they may just be emotional. They can get angry and sometimes extremely upset. How can you deal with someone who displays their emotions in this way?</p>
<p>Our natural inclination may be to tell them to calm down and not to be so emotional, or we may try to remove the emotion by focusing on logical arguments. We think they’ll be convinced that the logical thing for them to do is to be less emotional. This generally does not work because emotions are not formed out of logic and people can’t just make feelings go away.</p>
<p>When people are emotional, they need to be heard. Paraphrase and show them that you’ve heard what they said; that you can sense they’re upset; and that you want to hear more about what’s bothering them.</p>
<p>When people feel heard and understood, they’re more likely to regain their composure and focus on the problem that needs to be solved, rather than on their emotions.</p>
<h3>Personal Attacks</h3>
<p>What should you do if the other person engages in personal attacks? Some people think they can intimidate you and get the upper hand by saying things that they think will upset you. They think you may be afraid of them and make concessions. Other people may make personal attacks because they believe those things to be true of you. Either way, you have to decide how to respond.</p>
<p>When people attack us, our natural inclination is to attack back or defend ourselves. If you attack back, the negotiation is likely to break down. If you defend yourself, the discussion may shift to focus on your behaviour rather than on the issues you’re there to negotiate.</p>
<p>Instead of attacking back or defending yourself against personal attacks, try negotiation jujitsu: re-focus their attack on you into an attack on the problem. When the person says something derogatory about you, reframe it as a problem to be solved. For example, if someone says, “you’re obviously an inexperienced negotiator …,” you can reframe that by saying, “so how would an experienced negotiator find a fair solution to this problem?” Bottom line: don’t take the bait of a personal attack.</p>
<h3>Options and Ideas</h3>
<p>Sometimes, getting the other side to make an offer is like pulling teeth. They just won’t commit and you don’t know what they’re prepared to do.</p>
<p>Some people are afraid to make offers. They worry that their offers will either be too generous (and they will get a bad deal) or too aggressive (and you’ll walk away from the table).</p>
<p>One suggestion is to give them the time they need to make an offer. If they feel pressured to make an offer, you may not like the offer they make. Let them know that you’re always ready to talk and follow up regularly.</p>
<p>If you can’t give them the time, try to minimize their sense of risk about making an offer. For example, you may suggest that the two of you talk about options and explore what might be workable. They may be more comfortable putting options or ideas on the table, rather than offers. If an option they suggest is one you’d be prepared to accept, you may want to indicate that to them so that they will consider making it into an offer.</p>
<p>In a pinch, if you are prepared to do so, you can often get an offer from the other side by tabling your own offer, to which they will then likely counteroffer or respond.</p>
<h3>Authority</h3>
<p>Sometimes we find ourselves in a negotiation where the person on the other side of the table doesn’t have the authority to make a deal. They’ve negotiated as though they do have authority, but when it’s time to commit, they tell you they have to ‘take it back’ or ‘get approval’.</p>
<p>It’s always a good idea to ask at the beginning of a negotiation whether the other person has the authority to commit to a deal. If they don’t, you may be able to get the person with authority to come to the table.</p>
<p>If you have to negotiate with someone who doesn’t have the authority, you may want to try to reach a tentative deal, subject to approval by both sides. This allows you to avoid a situation in which you have a made a commitment and they haven’t, which increases the likelihood that they may come back to ask for more.</p>
<p>If you find out only at the end that they don’t have the authority to commit to a deal, you can ask whether they will at least recommend the deal to the person with authority. You could also ask them to troubleshoot with you any possible objections the person with authority might have to provide possible responses to any anticipated concerns.</p>
<h3>Competitive Bargainers</h3>
<p>How do you deal with a competitive or positional bargainer? Someone who takes a position, anchors and doesn’t move? These people frustrate us as we look for the magic formula to cause them to make concessions or show flexibility.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there’s no magic formula.</p>
<p>Usually, we try to convince them that they should move off of their position. We think of all of the reasoned arguments we can make and hope they will be convinced.</p>
<p>Try something counter-intuitive: instead of focusing on why their position is wrong, focus on trying to get an understanding about why they think they’re right. Show them that you’re open to be persuaded by them. Ask them how they came up with the position. In order to change someone’s mind, we need to first understand where their mind is; it is only when we fully understand their view that we can strategize most effectively to change that view.</p>
<p>Also, once you understand their justification for their position and have shown that you’re open to be persuaded by them, they’re much more likely to be open to be persuaded by you.</p>
<h3>Interrupting</h3>
<p>How do you know when to interrupt someone? We all want to be polite and let people finish their thoughts. However, if we don’t interrupt the other person they may think that we agree with everything they’re saying. Also, if we let them speak for a long time we may forget our own thoughts.</p>
<p>As a general rule, it’s better not to interrupt. No one likes to be interrupted and the other person may resent the interruption.</p>
<p>If you are worried that they may interpret your silence as agreement, one strategy may be to interrupt at an opportune time and indicate that, “I may not agree with everything you say and I’ll address your comments at the end, but in the meantime, please continue and I won’t further interrupt.” That way, you let the person continue and make it clear that you’re not necessarily agreeing with everything.</p>
<p>If you are worried about forgetting your points, you can write down your thoughts instead of interjecting them; this allows you to track your thoughts while allowing the other person to finish talking.</p>
<h3>Taking Breaks</h3>
<p>We have a tendency to want to push quickly through our negotiations. Unfortunately, that sometimes means we don’t get the benefit of taking a break.</p>
<p>Taking a break gives us a chance to sit back and consider what we’re doing and to think about whether we’re being pushed into a decision that isn’t ideal.</p>
<p>Taking a break with the other negotiator also gives us a chance to speak to them on a social level. Getting a coffee with the person you’re negotiating with can lead to unanticipated benefits. You start to see each other as people rather than as adversaries; this change in perception can lead to more creative deals.</p>
<h3>Expressing Emotions</h3>
<p>How can you use emotion to your advantage in a negotiation? One answer is to actually express how you feel, but in a calm, productive, purposeful way. If something is bothering you or upsetting you, say so and talk about it with the other person.</p>
<p>We sometimes think it’s wrong or ‘touchy-feely’ to talk about our emotions, so we hide them and avoid talking about them. But if we do talk about our emotions, others may react positively with a far clearer and more balanced view of what we say and do.</p>
<p>Most people have an internal desire to help others who are distressed and ask for help. When someone expresses distress, the response is generally sympathetic and may generate a supportive response.</p>
<h3>Discussing Consequences</h3>
<p>People often use threats in negotiations. They threaten the other side with what they’ll do if the other side doesn’t agree with them. “If you don’t like those terms, I’ll walk.” The problem with threats is they often just lead to counter-threats and an escalation of the dispute.</p>
<p>There’s nothing wrong with educating the other side about the consequences of what will happen if a deal isn’t reached, but it’s better to do so in a way that suggests you would prefer not to go that route, rather than presenting it as a threat.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean you should always tell the other side what you will do if no deal is reached. You should only disclose what you’ll do if it will be more beneficial than harmful. If your plan B is terrible, it’s better to avoid discussion about what will happen if you don’t reach a deal and just focus on the deal itself. Even if your plan B is good, if you reveal it, there is no incentive on their part to give you a higher value than your plan B would provide.</p>
<h3>The “Gut Feel” Test</h3>
<p>How do you know how much to disclose to the other side in a negotiation and how much to keep close to the vest? Many people think it’s just a ‘gut feel’ test and that you should disclose information if you feel comfortable but you should not if you feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The problem with a gut feel test is that your gut may not give you the right answer. You may disclose something that can hurt you or keep confidential something that may have allowed for a great creative deal.</p>
<p>It’s rarely a mistake to disclose information about your interests (your goals and concerns). If you let the other party know your goals and concerns, they may find ways to meet your interests that you hadn’t thought of.</p>
<h3>Be Honest</h3>
<p>What do you do when the other person in a negotiation asks you something and you don’t know the answer? You can’t be expected to anticipate every question.</p>
<p>Many people are embarrassed when they’re asked a question and don’t know the answer. They may feel the need to either make up an answer or avoid the question. Making up an answer definitely has pitfalls. Avoiding the question may not be much better as it may create suspicion.</p>
<p>The best approach is to be honest. It’s ok to say that you don’t know the answer to a question. You may need time to find out the answer, or you may not be able to get that answer. That’s okay. People appreciate it when you admit that you’re not perfect and don’t know everything. You will come across as genuine, which will be beneficial to your relationship.</p>
<p>You can also indicate that it’s a good question, and that you’d like to reflect and investigate further before responding, to ensure that the response is full and worthy of the question.</p>
<h3>Deal or No Deal?</h3>
<p>If you walk away from the negotiation, have you failed? Definitely not. Some of the best deals are the ones we don’t make. If you say no and instead, take a course of action that’s better for you than the deal on the table, you’ve made the right decision.</p>
<p>Untrained negotiators sometimes accept deals because they don’t want to fail. They see a deal as a success and no deal as a failure. Others accept deals because they’re bullied into them, or feel the time pressure and say yes just to get the deal done.</p>
<p>These are all bad reasons to say yes. You should only say yes if the proposal that’s offered is better for you than the result if you walk away. Otherwise, saying no is the right thing to do.</p>
<h3>Pushy Negotiators</h3>
<p>Some negotiators think that they get the best deals by being pushy and waiting for others to cave in.</p>
<p>Sometimes the other side does cave in and the pushy negotiator succeeds in getting what he or she wants. However, a number of things can go wrong if you’re too pushy in a negotiation. First, you may not get a deal when there is a deal that you could have reached. Pushing may push people away. Or a tit for tat reaction may occur, with both sides walking away from the table expecting the other to cave in and neither does. Everyone loses in this situation</p>
<p>Classic reactions to being pushed are pushing back, withdrawing, or locking in defensively.</p>
<p>Also, this style may permanently damage the parties’ relationship. That may or may not seem important in the moment, yet, it may be impactful at a later time.</p>
<h3>Listening</h3>
<p>Are the best negotiators quiet or more talkative? There’s no correct answer to this question. We all have to be comfortable with our own style. If you’re a talker, you may not be comfortable if you just listen. If you’re the quiet type, you won’t feel right if you try to dominate the discussion.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that the most effective negotiators do more listening than less effective negotiators. They gather the information they need while asking probing questions to find out more. Most people like to talk, especially about themselves and what they want. Asking them questions will make them comfortable and allow you to get more information. This can be very helpful in determining your next move in the negotiation. There is an old saying that one rarely learns anything while talking.</p>
<h3>Explore Options</h3>
<p>Can you negotiate with your wife or husband? Of course! You do it all the time. You decide who cooks, who takes out the garbage, who walks the dog, and what movie you go to. These are real negotiations that require real skill.</p>
<p>Negotiation is not just about giving in or bullying to get your way. Most of us wouldn’t consider bullying our partner about what movie we should go to, yet some of us might consider bullying the other side in a business negotiation. The challenge is in the long-term consequences to the relationship.</p>
<p>That’s not to say that giving in is the answer. Some of us just give in to our partner to avoid a fight. We end up doing things we don’t like and we resent it.</p>
<p>Neither extreme is necessary. In both our personal life and in business, we can explore options and find a solution that meets both our interests and the other person’s.</p>
<h3>Reciprocity</h3>
<p>We often hear about random acts of kindness and something inside of us wants to see the kind person benefit in some way. It only seems fair. Some of us even act on this and try to do something nice for the person who was kind, especially if they’ve done something nice for us. Reciprocity is a fairly universal value. People who receive something, tend to give something in return.</p>
<p>This is also true in negotiation. Random acts of kindness are often reciprocated. Some negotiators make a habit of giving the other side ‘gifts’ in the middle of a negotiation to try to improve the relationship and to trigger conscious or unconscious reciprocity. That is not to suggest that it’s always a good idea to give things away in negotiation, yet there are situations where the favour may be returned to you with even greater value.</p>
<h3>When is the End of a Negotiation?</h3>
<p>Most people think that the negotiation ends when the two sides shake hands or sign an agreement. The deal is done and they should stop negotiating. The truth is that there’s a lot more to negotiate.</p>
<p>First, most negotiations need implementation, and it’s a rare situation where there aren’t things we need to negotiate after we shake hands. If you’ve negotiated in an ethical way and preserved the relationship, you should be in good shape to deal with implementation.</p>
<p>Second, there are opportunities for all parties, if we continue to explore ways to sweeten the deal. Once you have an agreement, you can still discuss ways to improve it, as long as you do it in a way that doesn’t look like you are trying to get out of the original deal. Having such discussions is known as trying to make the deal ‘Pareto superior’ or ‘Pareto optimal’.</p>
<p>When we negotiate, we often keep information confidential and focus purely on the dollars. While that may help us meet our minimum needs, it may prevent us from coming up with the most creative and high value options.</p>
<p>With the safety of a deal in hand, parties are often more comfortable disclosing more information and exploring other ideas. That exploration may allow us to make the deal better for both of us. If we can’t improve the deal, we still have the one we’ve made to fall back on. The deal we’ve made is binding unless we both agree to change it. There is value, therefore, in disclosing information and discussing further ideas to see if you can improve on the deal you’ve already reached.</p>
<h3>Negotiation Tactics</h3>
<p>There are lots of negotiation tricks out there. Some people like to have the tallest chair, or sit at the head of the table, or have more people on their side of the table, or make you face out the window so you’ll be distracted.</p>
<p>These tactics often backfire by creating negative pushback. As a different approach, try to make them feel superior while negotiating a really good deal for yourself.</p>
<h3>Being Passionate</h3>
<p>We are all emotional, to a degree. Some of us show our emotions outwardly while others keep emotions in check. Many people think that effective negotiators hide and stifle emotions and that a show of emotion is a show of weakness. We disagree. There’s nothing wrong with being passionate about something. That can sometimes cause the other person to respond positively to your passion.</p>
<p>Even if you’re upset, it’s not necessarily bad to show that you’re upset. There is an honesty and fire in strong emotions that might strike a chord. One of our clients got angry during a pitch to a buyer. Instead of getting upset, the buyer was thrilled to see a pitch from someone who genuinely cared. Our client got the job.</p>
<h3>Making the First Offer</h3>
<p>Most people prefer it when the other side makes the first offer. We’re afraid that if we make the first offer, we may give away the farm. Or, that our offer may seem unreasonable to the other side and they will walk away.</p>
<p>Effective negotiators make offers that limit the likelihood of either of those scenarios playing out. For example, when they make first offers, they don’t present them as ultimatums, but rather as options to be discussed. Also, they try to base their offer on an objective, fair standard.</p>
<p>There can also be benefits to making the first offer. People who put the first offer on the table set the parameters of the negotiation. That first offer can establish a helpful precedent for how future offers should be made and communicated.</p>
<p>In addition, making a first offer can speed things up. Negotiators often go through a long drawn-out ‘dance’ where both sides are waiting for the other to make the first offer. The person who makes the first offer breaks the ice and allows the negotiation to move forward.</p>
<h3>There’s No Harm in Asking</h3>
<p>Most people assume that it is not possible to negotiate with retailers. When we see a price in a store, we assume that the price is final. In a lot of cases there is no ability to negotiate the price. However, in certain situations there may be an opportunity to negotiate.</p>
<p>The trick is to ask, and ask nicely, which few people actually do. The retailer can always say no. There was a study from the University of Pennsylvania where business students experimented with trying to negotiate the price of items for sale in retail stores. They were amazed to learn that, in many cases, they received significantly better prices simply by asking.</p>
<p>Price isn’t the only thing you can negotiate when you shop. You may be able to negotiate terms of payment, shipping fees, and a ‘throw in’ or another non-financial benefit. You’ll never know what is possible unless you ask.</p>
<h3>Sacrificing Ethics</h3>
<p>Do you have to sacrifice your ethics to be an effective negotiator? The answer is not at all. Some people believe that you have to mislead the other person to be an effective negotiator, which is just not true.</p>
<p>The most effective negotiators have learned the techniques that allow them to be honest and ethical while still being able to negotiate the best deal. There are ethical and effective approaches to all negotiation problems. Those who sacrifice their ethics become infamous and distrusted. People won’t want to negotiate with them and their careers end up being short-lived and stressful.</p>
<h3>Be Open and Friendly</h3>
<p>Does the environment surrounding your negotiations seem a bit chilly? We focus a lot on what we say during a negotiation, and not nearly enough on how we communicate our message. This is because we think more about the substance of what we’re negotiating and ignore the process. A friendly and open attitude toward someone else often causes them to be friendly and open to us. If you’re both open and friendly, your relationship will improve and you will be more likely to work out a good deal.</p>
<h3>Educate and Persuade</h3>
<p>When we want to persuade someone, we often tell them why we’re right and they’re wrong. The problem with this approach is that others rarely believe they’re wrong, and they certainly don’t like being put down. Instead of that approach, show them you’re open to their ideas and try to explore different options with them. If you have good information, use it tactfully to educate and persuade, not to prove the other party wrong.</p>
<h3>Asking Questions</h3>
<p>Salespeople are always negotiating with customers. What’s the biggest mistake they make when they’re trying to sell something? They talk about what they think their customers want rather than listening to what their customers have to say.</p>
<p>Customers and clients give us lots of clues about their needs and interests. We need to focus on listening to this information. The best salespeople don’t presume they know what their customers want. Instead, they ask lots of questions about the client’s goals, listen to the answers, ask clarifying questions, and only then provide potential solutions.</p>
<h3>Continuous Learning</h3>
<p>How much are you leaving on the table in your negotiations? What deals aren’t you making? Do others appear to know more about negotiation than you? No matter how much natural ability you have, you can improve your negotiation skills by learning new techniques.</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered why professional athletes still need coaches? The athletes are very skilled, yet they know that they can still get better results with coaching. If you learn one technique at a negotiation course that gets you a better result, wouldn’t that training be worth it? If you can improve your negotiation results by even five per cent in one year, you will have paid for the training.</p>
<h3>Fairness</h3>
<p>How do you convince someone that your proposal is fair? Fairness is a subjective concept and people have different ideas of fairness. Just because you think something is fair doesn’t mean the other person will think so too. One suggestion is to look to objective criteria, such as comparables. People are more likely to be persuaded by an objective verifiable fact-based standard than by your subjective (and biased) opinion.</p>
<p>Objective criteria are standards (such as legislation, industry standards, relevant facts, etc.) that originate from outside the specific negotiation and parties, but that can help negotiators answer questions about which they would otherwise argue. For example, if you’re buying or selling a house, you would want to know what similar houses have recently sold for, when trying to negotiate a fair price. Rather than relying on your opinion or theirs, you can share copies of MLS listings.</p>
<h3>Persuading Others</h3>
<p>Sometimes we forget that many of our conversations with family members are actually negotiations. We are trying to persuade them and they’re trying to persuade us about day-to-day matters such as where we will go for dinner, who takes out the garbage, and when the children go to bed. Effective negotiators are people who have the tools that let them persuade others at work AND at home.</p>
<p>One of the tools that effective negotiators use is that they consult before deciding. Most people don’t like edicts to be imposed. If you consult with others before you make your decision, they’ll feel that their voice has been heard and be more likely to accept the decision. It will also likely be a better, more-informed decision.</p>
<h3>Creativity</h3>
<p>A good negotiator is a creative one. We need to find creative solutions to problems so that we don’t get locked in a fixed-sum negotiation. How can we become more creative? One idea is to have a brainstorming session in your negotiation where all parties involved try to come up with creative ideas.</p>
<p>Brainstorming works best when you employ ground rules for the process, such as, no criticism of the options that are being generated; no comment or explanation on the front-end; and no commitment to the options during the generation phase (i.e. the options are not binding offers). If we free ourselves from having to worry about whether an option is good or bad when brainstorming, more creative options will likely flow.</p>
<h3>Avoid the Word “But”</h3>
<p>The word ‘but’ is the great eraser in a negotiation. It erases everything good that you said before. If I say to you, “You raise some good points, but your ideas won’t work,” you’ll likely focus on the second part of what I said &#8211; the dismissal part &#8211; and miss that I initially said you raised good points. When we use the word ‘but’ in the middle of a sentence, we can lose the positive aspects preceding the ‘but’.</p>
<p>If you can restructure your sentence and use the word ‘and’ instead of ‘but’, your opinions may land better with the other person. It’s even better to avoid either word. For example, what if I had said, “You do raise some good points. We also have to consider two practical difficulties we’ll encounter if we go down that path.” Your perspective will likely be received in a more favourable way.</p>
<h3>Listening to Others</h3>
<p>When we have something important to say, it dominates our thoughts and we feel a strong need to blurt it out. Unfortunately, the impact on others can be that they see us as pushy and unwilling to listen to what they have to say. When we listen to others first, they are more likely to want to listen to us. If we can take the time early in a negotiation to show others that we’re listening to them and then put forward our ideas, they’ll be more inclined to hear our ideas.</p>
<h3>“Front Door” Questions</h3>
<p>“What do you want?” and “Why is that important to you?” are important questions in a negotiation. They are front door questions to get us information about the other person. The more information we have about their motivations, goals, and concerns, the more likely we’ll be able to find a solution that works for everyone.</p>
<p>We are sometimes so focused on getting our own points across that we don’t take the time to obtain information from the other party that would assist us in coming to an agreement. Remember, we have two ears and one mouth and should use them in that proportion.</p>
<h3>Positions and Interests</h3>
<p>People often start a negotiation with their position. Your position is what you think the final result should be. Should we start a negotiation at the end, by asserting our pre-determined demand, or, should we clarify our goals and theirs, then work our way to a result that meets all our goals and concerns? What reaction do you think you will get to each approach?</p>
<p>If we take the time to hear other peoples’ ideas, find out about their interests and learn what’s important to them, we’re more likely to eventually craft an answer that we both find acceptable. If we lock ourselves into a position early in the negotiation, we may find ourselves arguing about our positions and making ultimatums, rather than searching for an answer that is good for both of us.</p>
<h3>Power to Persuade</h3>
<p>Sometimes you have to negotiate with someone who seems to have all of the power, such as your boss. In this scenario, you aren’t necessarily powerless. We all have the power to be more persuasive negotiators and use techniques to get others to cooperate with us.</p>
<p>For example, when you’re negotiating with your boss, you can refer to objective criteria or standards of fairness as a way to persuade them. Everyone likes to think that they’re a fair person. If you can persuade your boss as to what’s objectively fair, without embarrassing them, they may voluntarily head in that direction.</p>
<h3>Power Imbalances</h3>
<p>What is power in negotiation and how do you address a power imbalance? Substantive power in a negotiation may come from a negotiator’s ability to walk away from the table if the alternative is really good. If you want to improve your substantive power, you need to improve your plan ‘B’, the course of action you will take if you can’t reach a deal. By doing so, you’ll feel much more comfortable and empowered when you enter the negotiation.</p>
<h3>Offers and Counter-Offers</h3>
<p>A client recently asked why negotiations always include offers and counter-offers and can’t be focused on initially establishing each party’s real bottom line at the outset, in order to save time. It’s not necessarily efficient to start with offers and counter offers, yet, psychologically, some people like to see the other side make concessions before they are comfortable saying yes to a deal.</p>
<p>Concession-based styles can be frustrating, so consider how you can and will justify any offer that you make. Also carefully consider whether their offers and counter-offers can be justified. If their offer is arbitrary and unjustified, it should not prompt a concession from you. Making a meaningful concession to them in exchange for a meaningless concession from them only teaches that party that such strategies work. They will keep playing you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Tips for promoting client engagement, even from reluctant clients, include:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Clarify their ideal purpose &#8211; ask them what they would <em>like</em> to work on.</li>
<li>Acknowledge their concern/discomfort and inquire into the nature of the concern. Generate ideas with them on how to best deal with the concern.</li>
<li>Describe it as a joint or shared process (use ‘we’ instead of ‘you’) and make it clear that coaching is not disciplinary (if that is a concern, maybe you shouldn’t call it coaching).</li>
<li>Coach with confidence.</li>
<li>Tie the coaching in to what’s important to them and how it can help them achieve that goal.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the start of every coaching engagement, identify your client’s goals for the coaching session by using open-ended questions like:</p>
<ol>
<li>What do you want to achieve with the coaching?</li>
<li>What do you want out of this coaching session?</li>
<li>What do you need help with?</li>
<li>What do you see as the purpose of this coaching?</li>
</ol>
<p>Distinguish between the client’s goal/purpose for the coaching sessions (which may be to understand and manage your negative reactions) from their goals in a particular life situation they are facing, which may form the topic of discussion in the coaching session. In that life situation, their goal may be to get a better job with a better boss. Both levels of the client’s purpose are relevant to your coaching mandate.</p>
<h3>When we listen to clients as a coach:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Try to identify where they are, where they want to be, and what is the gap that needs to be bridged/filled.</li>
<li>Listen for clues to their deeper purpose for the coaching.</li>
<li>Actively draw out a deeper level of self-reflection and self-understanding with exploratory questions.</li>
<li>Listen for clues to the client’s challenges.</li>
<li>Identify any assumptions they might be making.</li>
<li>Listen to what their inner voice might be saying.</li>
</ol>
<p>When speaking to coaching clients, frame comments as factual observations rather than judgments/conclusions. Hold up an objective mirror, and let the client consider and analyze what the image means. Follow-up with questions to encourage further self-reflection by the client.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Know your purpose and act accordingly</h3>
<p>Everything you say and do in a conversation should be consistent with and designed to achieve your primary goals. First, you must identify what your primary purpose is, and then reflect on how to structure your conversation/negotiation to achieve that purpose. Beware the attraction of secondary goals (like saving face) that can take over a conversation and work against your primary purpose (keeping your job).<strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Ask sincere and open-ended questions</h3>
<p>Many customer service issues go into a dark place because a customer is not feeling heard or understood. One easy way to both make them feel heard and respected, but also to give you better information to evaluate and respond to a situation, is to ask good open-ended questions with a genuine and sincere desire to listen to the answers. “What is it that is upsetting you?” “What would you like to achieve today?” “Can you tell me what happened?”</p>
<h3>Listen, understand their perspective</h3>
<p>It is not enough to ask questions if you don’t actively listen to what they are saying. Be genuinely curious and open-minded. If you are, your facial expressions will likely be consistent with that mindset. If you have already made up your mind, your tone/body language/words will likely create the impression that you are impatient or don’t care about the customer’s issue, which will escalate the conflict. Hear them out where possible. Ask appropriate follow-up and exploratory questions. Paraphrase and summarize the key points they make. People who feel heard tend to feel respected as human beings, which makes any decision easier to take.</p>
<h3>Prepare. If you cannot, take a break to prepare</h3>
<p><strong> </strong>A little time spent preparing for a tough conversation/negotiation will yield tremendous benefits. Your words, actions, and body language will more likely align consistently with your message. You can craft a strategy and approach more likely to avoid negative reactions and to foster positive responses. Even a few minutes of thought can help you start a conversation more productively. Choose a tone that is more likely to achieve your goal, and have strategies in place to deal with anticipated hurdles, etc.</p>
<p>Winging it in a difficult conversation is a recipe for problems. If a conversation takes you by surprise and you have no time for prepare, remember that you don’t have to have the conversation in that moment. You can politely request some time to prepare, with an explanation as to why that extra time would be wise for all concerned. “I do want to talk about this issue, but I have my head full of the stuff from the meeting I just finished. And, there is some material in my office file that I want to review so that we can have a complete discussion. Can you give me 10 minutes to quickly run through the file so it is fresh in my mind?” If they insist on talking about the issue then, you can still hear them out, but you don’t have to respond until after you have had a chance to reflect.</p>
<h3>Share facts before reaching and acting on conclusions</h3>
<p><strong> </strong>Many of us walk into conversations with assumptions already in place about the issues or people. We have already reached conclusions, and so we speak and act in accordance with those conclusions (e.g. that the person is rude, or lying or greedy), consciously or otherwise.</p>
<p>Those conclusions are often wrong, at least in part, because we rarely have the full information about the person or issue. Prior to stating or acting on such conclusions, seek to create a shared pool of facts. By sharing the underlying facts, each side may feel more respected, trust may be generated, and the divide between the conclusions reached by each side might be much smaller. New facts can change their minds and our own.</p>
<h3>Focus on the future and engage in problem-solving</h3>
<p>Conflict often results from people focusing on the past and laying blame. It also arises when someone is not getting something that they want or need. If we can focus the conversation/negotiation on the future (where do we go from here), by brainstorming possible options, we may be able to craft a solution or path forward that makes everyone comfortable.</p>
<p>People who are getting what they need are much easier to deal with, and much happier than those who are not. People often anticipate that when they come to customer service, they will meet a wall of excuses. If instead, they are met with someone who helps them to solve their problem, they leave with a very different view of the organization and its staff.</p>
<h3>Acknowledge and emphasize where possible</h3>
<p><strong> </strong>Sometimes, we feel that acknowledging someone’s views is effectively giving in to that person or admitting fault. There are differences between admitting fault, sympathizing with someone’s pain, empathizing with their situation, and acknowledging their views or emotions.</p>
<p>Consider a customer who has two separate airline tickets, and who misses their connecting flight on Airline 2 because her flight on Airline 1 is delayed by mechanical issues. They will be upset when they arrive at the desk of Airline 2. Airline 2 has done nothing wrong. Technically, Airline 2 may have no legal obligation to do anything for the client because they were separate, independent tickets and the client has simply missed the second flight. That does not mean that the desk clerk cannot sympathize with the person (“Oh, that’s horrible, if that happened to me I’d be furious [with Airline 1].”). The clerk can empathize with the situation (“I fully understand why you’re upset and anxious.”). The clerk can acknowledge the emotion or a point of view. (“I can see that you’re very upset about the way this situation developed. If the delay was due to the airline’s actions, then they should help you find a solution.”) If we acknowledge that which should be acknowledged, we look reasonable and respectful. If we blindly defend the indefensible, then we look unreasonable, adversarial, and uncaring.</p>
<h3>Do not reject their views, state yours</h3>
<p>When we feel on the defensive in a situation, we often begin by actively countering the other person’s views, even before we have fully heard or considered them. We do this verbally (“But…” “No, no, no, that’s not…”) and with our body language (the doubting grimace, the dubious sneer, the rigid crossed arms, the held up hand in “stop” formation). We may do it without even realizing.</p>
<p>The message received by the other person is that we don’t care, we’ve made up our mind, and we’re just going to defend the party/company line. Instead of rejecting their views, even if you do disagree, you can still hear them out, and then <u>add</u> your different views to the conversation. In many cases, your views may not directly conflict with what that person is saying, though they may lead to a different conclusion. A person feeling respected will be more willing to listen to you, and work rationally towards a solution. Reject their views and they are likely to see you and treat you as an enemy.</p>
<h3>Know your hot buttons, avoid theirs</h3>
<p>Knowing your hot buttons is the first step to managing your reaction when those buttons are pushed. Similarly, if you can anticipate what might trigger negative reactions from the other person, and avoid those triggers, conflict can be minimized or avoided.</p>
<p>If you know that you get really hot under the collar when people interrupt you, you can think about why you react that way and how you might manage your response if it happens in your next meeting. If you know that your boss does not like having their authority questioned, you can think about whether, how, when, and where to raise an issue that may make them feel questioned.</p>
<h3>Think about how to say it, not just what to say</h3>
<p>Often in life, we are so busy that we focus only on the content of what we have to discuss, not the best way to frame that message from a process perspective. For a difficult situation, tremendous value comes from considering issues like the timing of a message, the tone of the discussion, the venue for delivering the message, the form (face-to-face, phone, written), the person delivering it, etc.</p>
<p>Optimizing the process for delivering the message makes it more likely that you can achieve the desired results on the substance of the conversation. One single process change might make the difference between success and failure. All the right words may be used, but they are worthless coming from a person who is not respected or trusted. Choose a different messenger and the message likely gets through.</p>
<h3>If you have to say ‘No’ to someone, but want to minimize the damage to your relationship with them, identify the impact of saying ‘Yes’</h3>
<p>Help them understand why you are saying no by pointing out the logical consequences of agreeing with them. If they can see the negative impact of Yes, they may alter their proposal to make it better, or they will at least understand (and not take it personally) when you say No. Framing a No as an “I can’t say yes because…” is subtly more positive.</p>
<p>“The consequences of going down that road are…”</p>
<p>“If I say ‘yes’, it means…”</p>
<p>“I just can’t say yes, yet, because…”</p>
<h3>Show flexibility and identify unsatisfied interests</h3>
<p>People who say “No” often mean “No, unless…” and have flexibility that may not yet have been revealed. If your “No” is rigid and unqualified, the other party may see no reason to continue exploring options with you. If you can demonstrate flexibility and also highlight the interests that need to be satisfied, the other party may sweeten their offer. Even if they walk away now, they may come back to the table later after thinking about their alternatives, knowing that you are open to a better offer.</p>
<ul>
<li>“I can’t say yes as things currently stand, but if you could help me by…”</li>
<li>“We’re close to a workable answer, but before I can say yes, I need…”</li>
</ul>
<h3>Respect the Customer</h3>
<p>Perceived disrespect creates a new conflict and ratchets the original one to a new, higher level.</p>
<h3>Act</h3>
<p>Follow-up on what you say you’ll do. Listening with nothing behind it seems like hypocrisy and a waste of their time. Your actions prove your sincerity, inaction the reverse.</p>
<h3>Genuinely Consider</h3>
<p><strong> </strong>Actively consider their perspective. Don’t assume they are lying or irrational. Put yourself in their shoes before judging.</p>
<h3>Help if You Can</h3>
<p>Even if only in a small way, find a way to make them better off than when they came to you. Even showing a willingness to help will make a difference. Give them a moral victory before they leave.<strong> </strong></p>
<h3>Make Each Customer Your First Customer</h3>
<p>When we see a lot of customers or complaints, we often get jaded, making it harder to listen to the next one. See each customer as an individual. Avoid judging them prematurely based on past experience with others. See them as if they were your very first customer. Put yourself in their shoes if you can, and see them as they see themselves.</p>
