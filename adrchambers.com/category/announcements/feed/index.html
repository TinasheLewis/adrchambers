<p><em>Originally published by the Ministry of the Attorney General</em></p>
<p>TORONTO — Today, Attorney General Doug Downey announced an essential next step to the full implementation of a first-in-Canada prompt payment regime to support jobs and growth in the construction industry. This regime will help cut through red tape, help create and protect jobs and attract investment to the province.</p>
<p>The implementation of these changes will prevent payment disputes from delaying work on construction projects, speed up the payment process and reduce time and money spent on litigation for businesses.</p>
<p>Following a fair and open selection process, <a href="https://adrchambers.com/">ADR Chambers </a>was selected as the successful candidate to serve as the Authorized Nominating Authority. This new body will oversee the adjudication process for construction disputes, including the training and qualification of adjudicators.</p>
<p>This adjudication system brings into force a new process that will give people and businesses a cost-effective and efficient alternative to settling payment disputes in court. Starting October 1, 2019, subject to applicable transition rules, parties to construction contracts and subcontracts will be able to receive a binding decision from an experienced construction adjudicator in approximately six weeks, a process that could take months or even years in the court system.</p>
<p>“Ontario is open for business and open for jobs, and our government is implementing industry- leading changes to the construction sector as part of our plan to restore the province as an economic powerhouse,” said Attorney General Downey. “The new construction adjudication system, as overseen by the Authorized Nominating Authority, will cut through the red tape that slows down the dispute resolution process – getting projects back on track and ensuring workers are paid on time.”</p>
<h4>QUICK FACTS</h4>
<ul>
<li>The Construction Act is intended to regulate how payments are made, to help ensure that workers who have provided services or materials during a construction project are paid for their work.</li>
<li>The Authorized Nominating Authority will be self-funded and operate independently of government.</li>
<li>ADR Chambers has provided dispute resolution services across Canada for over 20</li>
<li>Ontario’s construction industry employs more than 400,000 people and accounts for nearly seven per cent of the province’s</li>

<h4>WHAT INDUSTRY IS SAYING<strong> </strong></h4>
<p><strong>“</strong>ADR Chambers is honoured to have been selected as the Nominating Authority for Ontario’s prompt payment framework. We look forward to drawing on our expertise and experience as we work with the Ministry of the Attorney General and the construction community to realize full implementation of this exciting endeavour.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Allan Stitt, President, ADR Chambers</em></li>
</ul>
<p>“The appointment of the Authorized Nominating Authority is an important step in the creation of the dispute resolution system that is scheduled to be in place on October 1, 2019. We applaud our government for making this announcement and we look forward to working with the Ministry of the Attorney General and the ANA going forward.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Ian Cunningham, President, Council of Ontario Construction Associations</em><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>“OGCA welcomes the appointment of the ANA as the vital last step in implementing the new Construction Act. It will oversee and implement mandatory adjudication of construction disputes for the prompt payment requirements that will be in effect this October. The Construction Act is the biggest change to construction law in a generation and we require the ANA to provide quality adjudication services to ensure a smooth transition.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Clive Thurston, President, Ontario General Contractors Association</em><em> </em></li>
</ul>
<p>“Prompt Payment Ontario would like to thank the entire Ford Government for its commitment to delivering prompt payment in Ontario. The announcement of the Adjudication Nominating Authority has been highly anticipated and we are pleased that this crucial milestone has been reached.</p>
<p>Prompt payment and the new adjudication regime will be a monumental change that will create a more positive and fair business environment in Ontario’s construction industry. PPO looks forward to the October 1st when prompt payment comes into effect.”</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sandra Skivsky, Spokesperson for Prompt Payment Ontario</em></li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ADR Chambers announces the launch of the brand new Expedited Arbitration Rules.</p>
<p>Expedited Arbitrations are fast and cheap.  And there’s no wiggle room.</p>
<p>There’s a fixed fee so parties know exactly what they’re paying.  The fee is $7,500 per party for everything including the arbitrator’s fees, the room rental fees and the administration fees (including taxes).</p>
<p>There is a fixed time frame so parties know exactly how long the arbitration will take.  Arbitrations under the Expedited Arbitration Rules are concluded in under three months from the selection of the arbitrator to the written reasons.  Often faster.</p>
<p>The hearing will last only one day.  There is a set time for an opening, for cross-examination and for a summation.</p>
<p>Direct evidence is by affidavit only.  A maximum of two affidavits.  All evidence is admissible.</p>
<p>There are no preliminary motions.  There is no discovery.</p>
<p>The rules provide limits on number of pages for briefs, number of pages for affidavits, number of documents you can rely on and number of pages of documents.</p>
<p>A decision with reasons is rendered within two weeks of the day of the arbitration.</p>
<p>There are ways to make the process even shorter and cheaper if the parties want (e.g., in writing only arbitration or Final Offer Selection arbitration with no reasons).</p>
<p>The arbitrator does not have the jurisdiction to alter the rules, except on consent of all parties.</p>
<p>The rules will only apply if the parties agree to be governed by them, but if they do, they will participate in a fast and inexpensive process with an expert arbitrator.</p>
<p>Most of the ADR Chambers arbitrators have agreed to conduct arbitrations under these rules. To search for those arbitrators who have agreed to conduct Expedited Arbitrations for the fees in the Rules, please <a href="https://adrchambers.live/neutrals/">click here</a>.</p>

June 13, 2016</p>
<p>KITCHENER — Kitchener will pay a Toronto firm $250 an hour to advise councillors on the municipal Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Councillors voted Monday to appoint ADR Chambers, a dispute resolution firm, to provide integrity commissioner services for the next three years, replacing London, Ont., lawyer Greg Levine, who is retiring.</p>
<p>The move might save the city money, because it will only pay the firm for services received. Kitchener had paid Levine a retainer of $2,000 a year for the past eight years, even though it has never actually called on his services.</p>
<p>The integrity commissioner investigates alleged breaches of the city’s Code of Conduct, which sets out rules of acceptable conduct for members of council.</p>
<p>The code spells out accepted behaviour for council, and prohibits members of council from doing such things as using city property or city staff for personal purposes or as part of their re-election campaign, from threatening or intimidating city staff, and from disclosing matters dealt with in camera. It also bans close relatives of a member of council from working for the city, and requires council members to report any gifts worth $100 or more.</p>
<p>Councillors also asked city clerk Christine Tarling to investigate the potential for the firm to provide other services, such as advice to council members on the Code of Conduct or on conflicts of interest, or training new councillors. A report will come back later this year on what extra services the integrity commissioner could provide, what those might cost, and whether it makes sense to set an upper limit of, say $5,000, that any council member could run up in a year in seeking advice from the firm.</p>
<p>It might be useful to have the ability for councillors to get advice from the commissioner, said Coun. Paul Singh. “We are not legal experts. In many cases, we do need to actively seek out advice so we can take part in important decisions that define the future of our city.”</p>
<p>Kitchener contacted a number of other cities about their use of such commissioners; budgets ranged from $4,000 a year in Barrie to $20,000 in Markham.</p>
<p>Kitchener’s contract with for integrity commissioner services is a joint one with the cities of Cambridge and Waterloo. The vote at Monday’s finance committee meeting will need to be ratified at the next council meeting on June 27.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ADR Chambers Inc. has launched a new, flate-rate package for companies looking for a fast resolution to a business dispute.</p>
<p>For $6,000, companies or individuals who agree to an undergo an expedited arbitration can get their disputes heard and ruled on by former judges or senior lawyers within a 2.5-month time frame, explains Allan Stitt, president of ADR, a Toronto alternative dispute resolution company. That’s much faster than the traditional court system and a lot cheaper.</p>
<p>Mr. Stitt, a lawyer, says the cost of litigating disputes has skyrocketed. “You end up going to court paying such a significant percentage of what you’re arguing about. For the whole amount, it doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>He says the flat-rate arbitration is a “very abbreviated process and not something anyone can force on anyone else.”</p>
<p>Parties agree to follow strict rules on the length of materials they file and time frames, he says. There is no discretion for the arbitrators to agree to time extensions.</p>
<p>The parties are responsible for paying their own lawyers to represent them, Mr. Stitt adds, so the fee covers the arbitrator’s time and the use of facilities.</p>
<p>The participants submit a written brief and present their case at an oral hearing and the arbitrator provides reasons. There’s no formal appeal, though parties can turn to the court if there’s a denial of natural justice, which is standard in arbitrations.</p>
<p>Mr. Stitt says the process is best for disputes between $150,000 and $250,000, where legal fees can eat up the bulk of any award a court grants and it can take years to resolve.</p>
<p>Currently there is one dispute being heard since the service was launched last month and Mr. Stitt expects that it will be popular among companies that conduct business together, but which have a disagreement on the interpretation of a phrase in an existing contract and don’t want the matter to ruin their relationship by going to court.</p>
<p>Before launching the program, Mr. Stitt says he spoke to lawyers and judges and said he received “very positive opinions” about the need for such a service.</p>
<p>“I actually believe this will be the future of arbitration and gain momentum over the next few years.”</p>
