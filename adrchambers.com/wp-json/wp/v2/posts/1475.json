The founder and CEO of New York-based MediationLine LLC, a \u201cveteran\u201d of about 15 video mediations (plus portions of others) gives several reasons why online mediation should take off. For starters, legal bills can quickly add up, and as the current economic climate continues to take a toll, people\u2019s interest in saving money rises. Meanwhile, divorces, business disputes and other events calling for conflict resolution continue to occur.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also an increasingly techno-comfortable market segment that expects such services. \u201cIn a divorce I recently mediated, the male was in New York, while the wife had already moved to California,\u201d Maxwell explains. \u201cThey heard I handled mediation online and called me, asking to use Skype.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mark Shapiro is a newbie compared to Maxwell, having only participated in one commercial mediation so far. While with his former firm, the Toronto-based partner at Dickenson Wright LLP found himself in the offices of dispute resolution service provider ADR Chambers with the mediator (live) and the other party (via video feed from Ottawa).<br \/>\n<span id=\"more-94\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>\u201cSometimes you get cases in which dollar values aren\u2019t huge, and this makes mediation cost-effective,\u201d Shapiro says. \u201cTo mediate otherwise, lawyers and clients would have to travel.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Allan Stitt, president of ADR Chambers, admits cost savings may be the only reason to use what his company calls eVideo mediation. \u201cPeople can be in different cities and can cost-effectively participate in mediation,\u201d he explains. \u201cIf somebody has a three-hour mediation, they\u2019re only there for three hours.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Driving home the cost savings point, he openly states that ADR Chambers charges $250 per remote location, \u201cso lawyers ask whether they would rather pay the $250 or fly to another location for face-to-face meetings.\u201d (Maxwell\u2019s home page states that her services start at $249.)<\/p>\n<p>Joan Kessler is another newcomer to video mediation. \u201cI conducted a mediation where one party was in Korea,\u201d says the Los Angeles-based expert on intercultural communications, and mediator and arbitrator for ADR Services Inc. \u201cHe did not want to fly to LA, so we arranged with attorneys to use Skype.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt lasted all day for us and well into the night for him. I could see he grew weary, but I had him in the loop.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Shapiro figures the typical mediation process supports the logic behind video mediation. \u201cAfter the opening caucus, the mediator shuffles between parties sitting in different rooms. The parties are not in the same room 90 per cent of the time. Do they even need to be in the same city?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The end-to-end service from ADR Chambers impressed Shapiro. \u201cThe settlement documents were prepared, PDFed, signed and returned as if a mediator was there,\u201d he says. \u201cWe left that mediation with a signed settlement agreement.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Stitt claims the concept isn\u2019t new. \u201cAt a conference in the States, I attended a session on online dispute resolution and I wanted to figure out how to create an online mediation system, to create the same feeling you get in a live mediation,\u201d he recalls.<\/p>\n<p>The system at ADR Chambers differs from generic videoconferencing. \u201cThe mediator controls the process,\u201d Stitt explains. \u201cPeople can be all on together, and the mediator can \u2018drag\u2019 people (the mediator included) into caucus and other \u2018rooms.\u2019 The mediator can \u2018knock\u2019 on the \u2018door\u2019 of a caucus, asking if the party is ready to speak.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe mediator can pull up drawing tools to illustrate situations, fill in settlement agreements right on screen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maxwell and Kessler won\u2019t get such tailored features from services like Skype or Google Talk, but these services do have advantages: they\u2019re easy to install, easy to use, and free.<\/p>\n<p>Nobody claims video mediation is anything but a second-best option to live, face-to-face meetings, especially given the ease with which mediators can perceive non-verbal communication from people in the same room.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn one mediation, the couple sat together in a room and I was in another location,\u201d Maxwell says of one Google Talk session. \u201cI couldn\u2019t see them both onscreen, so they had to shift the camera. I could not see all the cues, the rolling eyes, the fidgeting.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt helps to do a face-to-face meeting first,\u201d Maxwell continues. \u201cI need to see how parties interact with one another.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Skype reliability hasn\u2019t been perfect either, as Maxwell claims she has had to switch parties to conference calls several times.<\/p>\n<p>Technical sophistication doesn\u2019t seem to be necessary. Kessler claims she isn\u2019t the most tech-savvy person, while Maxwell says she\u2019s comfortable with technology, and both quickly figured out Skype.<\/p>\n<p>Maxwell plans to do follow-up coaching post-mediation using online video. \u201cIt will probably take me a few months to build this out,\u201d she says.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Originally published in Lawyers Weekly Magazine Written by Luigi Benetton Link to Luigi Benetton\u2019s\u00a0website\u00a0with article Face-to-face mediations won\u2019t go away, but for cost reasons, they sometimes give way to videoconferencing.
