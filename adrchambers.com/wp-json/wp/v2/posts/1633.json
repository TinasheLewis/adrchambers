Many say no \u2013 but can anyone agree on what should replace it?<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a system that has evolved to respond to the legal challenges inherent to the global trade environment. But as trade agreements continue to proliferate and take hold, the treaty process that manages conflicts between states and foreign investors is, after decades of operating as an obscure and largely confidential arrangement between lawyers, emerging as a global political flashpoint. Growing unease about the perceived flaws of investor-state dispute settlement, or ISDS, is now emboldening critics calling for reform.<\/p>\n<p>Much of the current brawl started with the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations \u2014 and an advanced working draft of the trade agreement obtained by Wikileaks and published by the <em>New York Times<\/em> in early 2015. (The TPP negotiations ended in an agreement-in-principle in early October. A draft of the TPP agreement released by New Zealand in early November shows an ISDS system quite similar to those in other major trade deals, with three-person arbitral panels holding public hearings and delivering non-punitive monetary or restitution awards.)<\/p>\n<p>The draft laid out the TPP\u2019s approach to ISDS, a system by which foreign investors can sue states over government decisions that undermine their investments, through ad-hoc arbitration panels composed of lawyers \u2014 not judges. The working draft, dated Jan. 20, 2015, reflects the fact that negotiators expected the inclusion of ISDS to be controversial; the draft\u2019s cover mandates that the ISDS chapter remain classified until four years after the TPP comes into force.<\/p>\n<p>They expected controversy and they got it \u2014 from both directions. In Washington, prominent Democrats lined up to attack the ISDS provision as an assault on state sovereignty. \u201cThis continues the great American tradition of corporations writing trade agreements, sharing them with almost nobody, so often at the expense of consumers, public health and workers,\u201d Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio told the <em>Times<\/em>. Canadians were already talking about ISDS in connection with another trade deal \u2013 the Canada-Europe Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement \u2013 when the TPP draft was published. The NDP\u2019s Tom Mulcair, then leader of the Official Opposition, told a French think-tank in late 2014 that the European Union should not enact CETA if it includes the ISDS mechanism. \u201cEurope shouldn\u2019t let itself be locked into an agreement that contains such a provision, especially since it\u2019ll serve as the basis for an eventual agreement with the United States,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Opposition hasn\u2019t been limited to the centre-left. The Cato Institute, an American libertarian think-tank, recently hosted a lively online debate about ISDS, with leading experts such as trade policy analyst Simon Lester arguing that the current ISDS model \u2014 with its one-sided emphasis on foreign investors suing states \u2014 amounts to a closed, fundamentally unfair system that favours the rights of investors over all others. \u201cIn international investment law, these rights are only provided to a limited group \u2014 that is, foreign investors \u2014 and under an uncertain and unpredictable quasi-judicial framework,\u201d Lester wrote.<\/p>\n<p>In Europe, ISDS is under attack not only from the usual suspects in the anti-globalization left, but from the right as well. Marine Le Pen, leader of France\u2019s far-right National Front, ripped into the ISDS clause in the proposed EU-U.S. Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), calling it an attempt to \u201cundermine the sovereignty of member states.\u201d The Front\u2019s ideological cousin in Great Britain, the UK Independence Party (UKIP), also wants nothing to do with ISDS: UKIP Member of the European Parliament Roger Helmer described the ISDS clause in the TTIP as \u201ca private corporate-led arbitration court which would allow multinationals to sue states if their profits were challenged.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe notion of international law has always animated the extreme right in a negative way,\u201d says Andrea Bjorklund, the L. Yves Fortier Chair in International Arbitration and International Commercial Law at McGill University. \u201cBut yes, these are some strange bedfellows.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>Conflicted views<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not hard to see why ISDS gets under people\u2019s skin on both ends of the political bell curve. The system \u2014 as <em>The Economist<\/em> put it in a widely shared 2014 article \u2014 seems to many to have been designed \u201cto convince the public that international trade agreements are a way to let multinational companies get rich at the expense of ordinary people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere seems to be a pro-free-trade, conservative viewpoint out there now that sees ISDS provisions in trade treaties as dead weight,\u201d says Gus Van Harten, an associate professor at Osgoode Hall Law School and one of the most prominent critics of ISDS in the world.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cISDS is an interference in the marketplace. It displaces dispute settlement mechanisms in contracts. It\u2019s an extremely costly process, so it gives an advantage to the wealthiest and largest foreign companies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>ISDS clauses are written into more than 3,000 trade treaties worldwide; the TPP would vastly expand the ISDS reach to cover 12 nations, 800-million people and 40 per cent of global GDP. Under ISDS treaty clauses, a foreign investor has the right to sue the governments of countries in which it invests for arbitrary actions that void or limit its property rights. The decisions that emerge from the process cannot be used to overturn a state\u2019s policy \u2014 but they can order a state to pay vast sums in compensation. In a single ISDS claim brought against Ecuador after it cancelled an oil-exploration contract with U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum, the state was ordered by an ISDS tribunal to pay $1.77-billion US in compensation \u2014 roughly what Ecuador spends on health services annually. In 2013, the multinational pharmaceutical maker Eli Lilly sued Canada under NAFTA\u2019s ISDS chapter for $500-million, accusing Canadian courts of illegally striking down two of its patents. (Canada is fighting the claim.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI always tell my students not to think of ISDS as a system, because it\u2019s not a system,\u201d says Debra Steger, a law professor at the University of Ottawa who wrote a widely read 2012 paper on establishing an appellate mechanism for ISDS.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe weird thing about international investment law is that nothing in it happened by design. It\u2019s a field that grew up by accident since the explosion in new investment treaties in the 1990s. It was based on commercial arbitration, which was not designed. It all evolved through practice, and that\u2019s really important to keep in mind.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An ISDS claim is judged by an ad-hoc panel of arbitrators, usually three of them \u2014 one appointed by the investor, one by the state and the third by mutual consent. These arbitrators are lawyers, not judges. They don\u2019t have to follow legal precedent and their decisions are not open to appeal \u2014 although there are limited grounds for annulling an award under the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes Convention, or for setting aside an award under a UN convention.<\/p>\n<p>ISDS arbitrators are not public servants; they work case-by-case and bill by the hour or day. Top firms engaging in ISDS work can make $3-$5-million on a single case, or even more \u2014 a factor that ISDS\u2019s foes say encourages arbitrators to prolong cases. Arbitrators aren\u2019t salaried or employed by any constitutional state that could guarantee security of tenure \u2014 making them, according to ISDS\u2019s critics, vulnerable to pressure to issue rulings that favour one side or another. And because arbitrators are not judges, they don\u2019t have to observe judicial strictures on conflict of interest: they can work both sides of the fence \u2014 sitting on an arbitration panel in one case, acting for a foreign investor in another \u2014 a situation critics say is ripe for abuse.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019re acting as an arbitrator and as a lawyer on the side, you have the potential to issue a ruling that favours one of your clients,\u201d says Van Harten. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t let judges work as lawyers \u2014 it\u2019s a clear conflict. The parties can challenge the appointment of a particular arbitrator but, right now, that is the only safeguard.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The ISDS model is based on commercial arbitration, a procedure that puts a premium on confidentiality. Most ISDS awards are now made public but most of the supporting documentation is not (except in the case of NAFTA, which publicizes most ISDS documents \u2014 but only covers about 15 per cent of ISDS cases worldwide). That standard of confidentiality can prove embarrassing for states forced to pay out large sums on investor-state claims without being able to tell taxpayers exactly why.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s on the matter of disclosure that the ISDS model has seen its most significant reforms over the past two decades. In 2001 the NAFTA states issued an interpretive statement to the effect that nothing in the treaty prevents the member states from making arbitrations public; even opponents of ISDS admit Canada, the U.S. and Mexico have been pretty good about disclosure. In the 2001 Methanex case \u2014 which saw the Canadian maker of a gasoline additive banned in California file for compensation under NAFTA\u2019s Chapter 11 \u2014 the arbitration panel opted for the first time ever to let an outside party, the International Institute for Sustainable Development, file an amicus brief, widening the tight circle of ISDS participants ever so slightly. The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law\u2019s transparency rules, which came into effect in April 2014, provide for the publication of tribunal documents, transcripts and awards. They also allow for third-party statements and require that most hearings be public. But the new UNCITRAL rules don\u2019t apply to new arbitrations launched under existing treaties (the TPP draft includes transparency rules mandating that documents be made available online and that tribunal hearings be open to the public). In late 2014 the UN General Assembly adopted the Mauritius Convention on Transparency, which allows adopting states to apply the UNCITRAL transparency rules to existing treaties; Canada is one of the nations that have adopted Mauritius.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Who is at a disadvantage now?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>ISDS was conceived as a parallel legal stream to protect foreign investment in countries with shaky court systems, or where the line between the judicial and executive branches is blurry at best. So it\u2019s attractive to countries like Canada that are highly dependent on the extractive sector: while a foreign manufacturer can always down tools and pull out of a country which refuses to respect its property rights, a resource company \u2014 a mining or a logging firm \u2014 has to go where the resources are.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn some countries the courts aren\u2019t necessarily equipped to protect a foreign investor\u2019s legal rights,\u201d says Bjorklund. \u201cAnd there\u2019s a more generalized concern about foreigners being at a disadvantage in a country\u2019s courts because of bias against them. The argument is much less strong in countries with effective court systems. But even among the 28 members of the EU you have countries with very weak justice systems.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>And that is where ISDS\u2019s supporters part company with many pro-trade conservatives. ISDS grew up in a very narrow context \u2014 one consisting mostly of North American and European investors operating in mostly non-Western nations, where the local justice systems weren\u2019t considered experienced, honest or independent enough to protect outside money. But the trend in trade over the last two decades has been toward very large multi-nation treaties that put those same Western nations together under the ISDS umbrella; while foreign investors from small states might not have the resources to go\u00a0after, say, the United States, a Japanese multinational certainly would. \u201c[The United States Trade Representative] will say the U.S. has never lost a case, but you\u2019re going to see a lot more challenges in the future,\u201d Senator Brown told <em>The Times<\/em>. \u201cThere is a huge pot of gold at the end of the rainbow for these companies.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a scary thing for governments to face, and you\u2019re seeing a political backlash now,\u201d says Louise Barrington, a chartered international arbitrator who splits her time between Toronto and Hong Kong.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOnce one\u2019s own country gets burned by an ISDS award, one tends to pay more attention. When it was just Americans, Canadians or Europeans going into, say, Nepal with investments, few people in those countries noticed \u2014 not until the tables were turned.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In other words, the \u201cpolitical backlash\u201d against ISDS is really about national sovereignty \u2014 about whether investor-state arbitration rulings have the power to undermine or reverse decisions made by sovereign governments. ISDS tribunals don\u2019t have the power to order a state to overturn or modify a law or regulation \u2014 but the vast sums of money involved could convince a government to back down, especially if the parties reach a settlement before a ruling is issued.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYes, there could be a knock-on effect from an ISDS award to an investor. The nation involved might think twice about such a policy initiative in the future,\u201d said Bjorklund. \u201cBut remember \u2014 investors lose more than half of the cases they bring through ISDS.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As proof that ISDS cases have the potential to change government policy, critics often cite Germany\u2019s 2011 move to settle a 1.4-billion Euro claim by the Swedish energy company Vattenfall over the government\u2019s decision to impose strict water use restrictions on a coal-fired power plant the company was planning to build; Germany subsequently withdrew the restrictions. More infamous still is the still-unsettled case of cigarette maker Philip Morris, which is taking the United Kingdom to court over its move to impose \u201cplain packaging\u201d as a health measure and already has launched a challenge of Australia\u2019s plain-packaging law under an Australia-Hong Kong investment treaty.<\/p>\n<p>The Philip Morris case is also cited as a prime example of another flaw in ISDS \u2014 so-called \u201ctreaty shopping,\u201d where an investor reorganizes its corporate structure in order to exploit an ISDS clause in a bilateral treaty. Australia has accused Philip Morris of shifting its regional headquarters to Hong Kong to take advantage of the treaty.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, proponents of the trade deal point to provisions that recognize the right of governments to pass laws in the public interest, namely in environmental and public health matters.<\/p>\n<p><strong>No precedent<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>But many critics say the real problem with ISDS isn\u2019t the potential for conflict of interest, or the risk that states might make policy decisions based on the threat of a successful claim \u2014 it\u2019s the fact the ISDS system isn\u2019t designed to fix its own mistakes.<\/p>\n<p>In an ordinary court of law, judges are expected to follow precedent and their rulings are subject to appeal \u2014 two factors that are supposed to ensure that the law is applied consistently and without bias. ISDS doesn\u2019t work that way; its annulment mechanism is based on procedure, not law, so it\u2019s not meant to correct errors in law. In a sense, lack of consistency is a design feature of ISDS: as Bjorklund points out, imposing precedent and appeals on the ISDS process might be seen by state parties to investment treaties as a constraint on their sovereign right to enter into those treaties.<\/p>\n<p>Some argue that this design feature undermines ISDS\u2019s reason for existing in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe whole point of treaties is to secure some level of certainty and predictability in the way nations deal with each other,\u201d says Steger. \u201cInternational investment law is completely fragmented, which is why you see very different rulings on cases that have very similar facts. I know of three separate ISDS tribunals that issued rulings against Mexico for three different companies \u2014 the cases were all very similar, but the rulings were all different. And that\u2019s under just one treaty.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo yes, it\u2019s a bit of a crapshoot. That lack of certainty, of consistency, in the outcomes is not a good thing for government or business planning.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><strong>A better ISDS regime?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>What all of these criticisms boil down to is this: the ISDS model is now deeply controversial in the capitals of the West. Negotiations on the European Union\u2019s proposed trade and investment deal with the United States \u2014 the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership \u2014 had bogged down on multiple fronts by late September, but it was widespread European hostility towards ISDS that threatened to kill the deal entirely. In July, the European Parliament voted to support the TTIP on the condition that ISDS is replaced with something closer to a conventional court system.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere has been, and is, a fundamental lack of trust by the public in the fairness and impartiality of the old traditional ISDS model,\u201d European Commission Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstr\u00f6m told journalists in September as she was announcing the EC\u2019s pitch for a replacement system: an international investor-state dispute settlement court.<\/p>\n<p>The proposed court, or Investment Court System, would employ 15 independent judges appointed publicly by the European Union, the U.S. and a third country, thus addressing the problems of conflict and independence inherent in ISDS. The ICS would hold open hearings. It would have an appellate level with six judges \u2014 meaning it would be able to correct errors in rulings and follow precedent. The ICS proposal would ban treaty-shopping (although it\u2019s not clear how), limit and define the types of discriminatory state behaviour that could trigger a claim by a foreign investor, and explicitly affirm the right of states to regulate for the public good.<\/p>\n<p>In short, the ICS model is an attempt at compromise \u2014 and like all such attempts, it isn\u2019t making anyone particularly happy. Those in the arbitration sector question the need for a new bureaucratic body at the international level \u2014 with the threat of politicization and deadlock that implies.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think this could end up being like the United Nations \u2014 an institution that looks great on paper but which gets captured by political interests,\u201d says Martin Valasek of Norton Rose Fulbright in Montreal, who works in arbitration. \u201cThere is a risk that judges appointed to this court would feel obliged to represent the interests of the nations that appointed them.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAnd what happens if we get an international court of appeal for investment and it makes a bad decision? You have to live with it. ISDS is flexible, it\u2019s a blank slate because it isn\u2019t strictly bound to precedent.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Barrington sees a potential problem with credibility: \u201cMany states with developing economies feel the arbitration system is already weighted in favour of the West. Imagine how they would react to a group of old guys making these decisions in some Western capital.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Bjorklund sees practical problems \u2014 starting with the fact that the proposed ICS is only intended to apply to the TTIP and possibly future treaties. \u201cWould every treaty go through a single appellate body, or just one appellate body per treaty? Would such a body not violate the sovereign right of states to enter into treaties? The idea of a single international investment treaty looks like pie in the sky at this point.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you want to eliminate the risk of conflicts of interest, you\u2019re going to have to pay arbitrators a salary so they\u2019re not tempted to take other jobs. Who\u2019s going to pay for it?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Van Harten says that while the ICS model would solve some of the problems with ISDS, it wouldn\u2019t address the main one: the fact that foreign investors have access to a justice system all of their own, exclusively devoted to investor claims against states.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cImagine a Charter of Rights that only protected multinational companies and wealthy foreigners, based on uncapped orders of compensation,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Still, if governments are serious about reforming the way investor-state disputes are settled (and assuming they don\u2019t want to go back to the bad old days of gunboat diplomacy) some sort of international body is probably the way to go. Reconciling it with 3,000-plus separate trade treaties \u2014 that\u2019s going to be the tricky part.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnless we start thinking about this stuff now, how are we ever going to get out from under this ad-hoc process that nobody seems to be very happy with?\u201d says Steger. \u201cI don\u2019t mean the arbitrators themselves \u2014 they\u2019re lobbying tooth and nail to keep things as they are.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is a policy purpose to these treaties, and ISDS can\u00a0be reformed. The whole reason for ISDS in the first place was that foreign investors cannot sue in domestic courts for the remedies ISDS provides. We don\u2019t need to throw the baby out with the bathwater.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Doug Beazley nationalmagazine.ca winter 2015-2016 Should trade deals like the TPP give foreign investors their own justice system to settle claims against states?
