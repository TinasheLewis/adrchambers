With both sides at an impasse, the Toronto Star asked Allan Stitt, a Toronto-based mediator and arbitrator who lectures on conflict resolution, for some insight into high-stakes negotiations.<\/p>\n<p>Q. Is this one of the worst examples of a stalemate that you\u2019ve ever seen?<br \/>\nA. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the worst because the impact is so severe,\u201d Stitt said. The gridlock has caused the U.S. dollar to fall and threatens to damage the country\u2019s credit rating. But, Stitt said, stalemates like this happen all the time. \u201cThey are very common because both sides are trying to out-think the other side in terms of what they\u2019ll be willing to do and when they\u2019ll be willing to cave.\u201d<br \/>\n<span id=\"more-108\"><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Q. What drives a situation like this?<br \/>\nA. Stitt said it often gets to the point where both sides could theoretically say Yes to what the other side is offering but each thinks they can cause the other side more pain by holding out. \u201cThey believe that if (they) holdout a bit longer, the other side is going to cave,\u201d he said, adding that in moments of honesty, they might admit they would be better off accepting what the other side has to offer.<\/p>\n<p>Q. So how do you break through that?<br \/>\nA. Mediators always look for ways their clients can save face while getting what they really want -rather than what they say they want &#8211; without forcing them to go to the other side\u2019s position. That\u2019s the best-case scenario and a solution that\u2019s so often open to people and they don\u2019t explore it,\u201d Stitt said. More commonly, both sides end up making concessions until they hit middle ground. \u201cPeople start to realize that they\u2019re hurting everybody and in this case, they\u2019re hurting an entire country by continuing to be obstinate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Q. Is there any way for the two sides in the U.S. to save face?<br \/>\nA. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d Stitt said, but they have to get creative. If both sides could get together privately, with a promise that discussions would not be leaked to the media, they could talk honestly about what they really want and need.<\/p>\n<p>Q. Do you think it\u2019s more likely they\u2019ll start making concessions instead?<br \/>\nA. \u201cUnfortunately, the practical reality is they just start giving on issues,\u201d he said, adding that the real problem is posturing from both sides. \u201cNobody really knows which issues are really important to either side because they\u2019re all pretending that every issue is extremely important.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Q. What are some of the other classic mistakes made in negotiations?<br \/>\nA. \u201cThey get caught up in their own rhetoric\u201d Stitt said.\u201d Over time, they become so entrenched in their positions that it becomes a matter of principle and they\u2019re unwilling to budge, he said. \u201cThat\u2019s really what\u2019s happening here\u201d.<\/p>\n<p>Q. This is a pretty juicy negotiation. Would you like to be stuck in the middle of this?<br \/>\nA. \u201cThe truth is, I would,\u201d Stitt said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s the eternal optimist in me but I do believe that there are creative ways to overcome some of these difficulties. Sometimes you need someone in the middle to take the pressure on them instead of on the parties.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Toronto Star &#8211; Toronto, Ont.
