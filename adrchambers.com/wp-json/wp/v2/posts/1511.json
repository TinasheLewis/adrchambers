He says the vast majority of disputes don\u2019t justify a full-blown arbitration process and there is an opportunity now for the arbitration community to start coming up with ways people can do arbitration in an expedited way.<br \/>\n<span id=\"more-326\"><\/span><br \/>\n\u201cI think what\u2019s going to happen next is some lawyers are going to really try to be creative and other lawyers will have to be brought along kicking and screaming to say proportionality is going to have to become more important than due process in arbitration \u2014 and that\u2019s for me the crucial thing,\u201d Stitt says. \u201cOnce people take that step, then all bets are off. Anything goes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Stitt says he\u2019s developed expedited rules and seen others try to use similar ones only to meet resistance. ADR Chambers has done a few cases using Stitt\u2019s rules and they\u2019ve gone well, he says, but you need \u201creally forward-thinking\u201d lawyers on both sides. More often than not, one of them says no, but despite some pushback, he is sure this is where arbitration is headed.<\/p>\n<p>Brian Casey, of Bay Street Chambers, agrees that arbitrators have to find ways to be creative in their delivery, but he warns that they also must be careful not to become slaves to a rigid procedure.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe got into arbitration in part to avoid the sometimes overly rigorous rules of court and one thing you don\u2019t want to see is arbitrators simply developing a new set of rules that they think must be followed,\u201d he says. \u201cFlexibility is key.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>For Paul Torrie, president of Global Resolutions, the fact it\u2019s a non-regulated profession means for mediators to continue to be value added to the process, they need to \u201cup their game on their creativity\u201d through their effectiveness, energy and perseverance.<\/p>\n<p>In line with Stitt, Torrie thinks that, going back to evolutionary process, \u201cwe reached one plateau of development and are about to launch into another.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He adds the Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in R. v. Jordan has had the effect of essentially prioritizing criminal cases, which consequently pushes civil cases further down on the priority list.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis means mediation becomes even more relevant and important,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the last few years, there\u2019s been a greater number of people offering mediation services and as a consequence I think there are a lot more options for counsel and their clients. I think that\u2019s very healthy and good for everybody.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Paul Iacono, founder of YorkStreet Dispute Resolution Group Inc., says all of the problems in the area of civil justice that created the need for ADR in the first place are still there \u2014 if anything, they\u2019re getting worse. Civil justice and ADR will always be joined at the hip, he says.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening now is maybe one per cent of all of the civil actions that are launched are actually getting to trial,\u201d Iacono says. \u201cWhen they get to the courthouse, they take too long. So there will always be a need for ADR.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Casey agrees the demand for ADR is still high, adding the cases he deals with most vary year to year, though he\u2019s found it evenly divided between domestic and international work lately, with \u201ca lot of work in the energy field in arbitration.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>While the biggest area is still insurance and personal injury, this historical leader is losing some of its dominance, says Iacono.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThat business is shrinking because there\u2019s going to be fewer lawsuits, the threshold\u2019s higher, the deductible\u2019s higher,\u201d he says. \u201cI think, eventually, in the area of accident benefits, that\u2019s probably going to turn into something like workers compensation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Torrie agrees the majority of work Global Resolutions does has a negligence base to it, and he says that, for his firm, the second largest group after that is commercial matters.<\/p>\n<p>The area of estates mediation is a rapidly growing area. These cases are more traditional mediation, Iacono says, noting it\u2019s becoming a huge source of litigation as \u201cbillions of dollars pass from one generation to the next and there is inevitably arguments,\u201d usually about money. They are straightforward disputes, he says.<\/p>\n<p>One area that\u2019s challenging YorkStreet right now is work with First Nations, which Iacono says is groundbreaking.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt requires what I call a \u2018hybrid form\u2019 of mediation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt really is a team approach because in these kinds of disputes there are so many moving parts. You need neutrals with special skills. You require someone who can bridge the cultural gap and someone who can sort through multiple layers of conflict.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He says he\u2019s been refining techniques because the mediation process is fluid.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGoing down the road we\u2019re going to be thinking about how can we refine our approach, how can we make it better? We\u2019ve seen it work and now we have to take on some tougher challenges.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another trend noted was an increased interest in ADR by younger partners and associates in litigation firms.<\/p>\n<p>Though Casey says there is a higher degree of co-operation expected and he finds in some cases they still have to educate counsel on that fact, he speculates younger lawyers are more comfortable because they\u2019ve taken a course in ADR, noting when he went to school there was no such thing.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCanada is small, relatively speaking,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get educated by experience, the only other way is to get educated by learning through books and courses and whatnot. I think in this country in particular education is the key.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Torrie, who has been practising ADR since the late \u201980s, says he\u2019s seen an evolution in mediation practice that has become a stand-alone discipline of mediation advocacy.<\/p>\n<p>Most lawyers on the civil side accept their cases will most likely be argued in a mediation room than a courtroom, he says, and as a consequence the \u201cskill package\u201d they need is a combination of advocacy and negotiation \u2014 and there is a corresponding trend in the training of lawyers that he says is positive.<\/p>\n<p>Torrie spoke to Canadian Lawyer from an empty classroom at Queen\u2019s University School of Law where he was waiting to speak to a class focused on mediation advocacy and skills.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing now are lawyers who are emerging from law schools into a practice where they\u2019re more focused on how they\u2019re going to be successful in a mediation as opposed to a trial,\u201d he says.<\/p>\n<p>Osgoode Hall Law School at York University is also offering classes on ADR. Iacono spoke to students focusing on ADR early in March and told them if they decide to go into the practice of litigation it is very likely it will be 10 years or more before they get into a courtroom in front of a Superior Court judge, because of problems in civil justice. Because of the growth of ADR, on the other hand, they\u2019ll be mediating their first case within a week.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a growing area in law school, and that\u2019s good \u2014 it\u2019s important,\u201d Iacono says. \u201cIt\u2019s a great procedure. For our fellow citizens, a lawsuit is a pathological experience. Arbitration is informal, relaxed, nobody bites them. It\u2019s a process that flows and you get a dispute settled in a day. What could be better?\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Written by Mallory Hendry Posted on\u00a0www.canadianlawyermag.com\u00a0on May 15, 2017 Demand for alternative dispute resolution growing in wake of Jordan.
