The deal is really only the successful conclusion of an effective negotiation process. It is however, the process used to achieve the desired negotiated outcome, which accurately defines negotiation.<\/p>\n<p>An effective negotiation process expands dialogue and develops crucial information around which a deal might be structured.\u00a0Effective dialogue and productive information development is driven by advanced questioning and strong probing skills.<br \/>\nNegotiation theory draws on various disciplines including psychology, mathematics (game theory), communications, anthropology, sociology and others.\u00a0I would like to draw on philosophy, specifically Cartesian logic, to introduce you to a simple, yet powerful questioning technique to add to your negotiation quiver.<\/p>\n<p><strong><u>The Four Cartesian Questions<\/u><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>At the core of Cartesian logic, credited to the French philosopher Rene Descartes, (1596-1650), is a set of four simple questions that are useful in evaluating any action or decision. The questions are (where X is the question or action you are contemplating):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What would happen if you did X?<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What would happen if you didn\u2019t do X?<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What won\u2019t happen if you did X?<\/li>\n<li>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0What won\u2019t happen if you didn\u2019t do X?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>To illustrate how these questions are implemented, consider being faced with the question of settling a dispute rather than going to court. I would apply the Cartesian questions as follows:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>What would happen if I settled?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>I would save time and money.<\/li>\n<li>I would have closure.<\/li>\n<li>Maybe the relationship could be salvaged<\/li>\n<li>I could put my energy and resources in more productive pursuit.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>What would happen if I didn\u2019t settle?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>I would have the uncertainty of court.<\/li>\n<li>I would be tied up in discovery, depositions and trials indefinitely.<\/li>\n<li>I would be derailed from more productive efforts<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>BUT<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I might win the case.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>What won\u2019t happen if I settled?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>I won\u2019t ever be able to litigate the case.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>BUT<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>I won\u2019t need to spend resources on litigation.<\/li>\n<li>There won\u2019t be a public record of the dispute.<\/li>\n<li>There won\u2019t be further animosity and acrimoniousness.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>What won\u2019t happen if I didn\u2019t settle?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>I won\u2019t be relieved and at peace.<\/li>\n<li>I won\u2019t be able to have any relationship with the other party.<\/li>\n<li>I won\u2019t be able to forecast the budget with the looming uncertainty surrounding the cost of continuous fighting.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Although on the surface, these questions may seem repetitive, they are effective in helping parties to understand the consequences of decisions and actions from a 360 degree perspective. They also challenge the parties to think about things in new ways that they may not have before, thereby providing fresh and valuable insights.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Lessons Learned<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Defining negotiation as \u201cmaking the deal\u201d is a common misconception.<\/li>\n<li>Negotiation is defined by the process used to achieve the desired negotiated outcome.<\/li>\n<li>An effective negotiation process expands dialogue and develops crucial information around which a deal might be structured.<\/li>\n<li>Effective dialogue and productive information development is driven by advanced questioning and strong probing skills.<\/li>\n<li>Use the four Cartesian questions in your negotiations, which are:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol>\n<li>What would happen if you did X?<\/li>\n<li>What would happen if you didn\u2019t do X?<\/li>\n<li>What won\u2019t happen if you did X?<\/li>\n<li>What won\u2019t happen if you didn\u2019t do X?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<ul>\n<li>They can be used within your own team in evaluating an action, strategy, decision or proposal.<\/li>\n<li>They can also be very useful in questioning the other party to help them see the various consequences of a particular course of action realistically.<\/li>\n<li>Use them to evaluate a proposal or to walk the other side through evaluating your offer.<\/li>\n<li>They are a powerful means of generating constructive dialogue and obtaining crucial information towards building satisfying outcomes.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Derek Sarluis As Third Party Neutrals we ask open-ended questions in order to\u00a0bring\u00a0information to the surface that can reveal the needs, hopes, perceptions, fears and\u00a0expectations of the parties, the true crux of the dispute, and what is possible\u00a0in order to\u00a0attain a resolution. \u00a0The\u00a0answers, however, may or may not\u00a0lead\u00a0a conversation surrounding resolution.
