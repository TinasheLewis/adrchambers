The deal, sealed in an oral contract in 2012, didn\u2019t make mention of sales taxes, Huberman says.<\/p>\n<p>The CRA took the unpaid tax from his client\u2019s account, arguing the plaintiff should have collected the tax on behalf of the government from the buyer of the gold. At that point, Huberman says the plaintiff sued the buyer for the HST, plus interest and legal fees.<\/p>\n<p>He argued before the Superior Court of Ontario that s. 224 of the <em>Excise Tax Act<\/em> allows a supplier to \u201cbring an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover the tax from the recipient as though it were a debt due by the recipient to the supplier.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe buyer has the legal liability to pay it,\u201d says Huberman. \u201cOurs was simply to collect it and remit, which we didn\u2019t do. The CRA scooped the money from my client\u2019s corporate account, so we paid the outstanding bill.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Huberman, acting for the firm, turned to an \u201cesoteric section,\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/laws-lois.justice.gc.ca\/eng\/acts\/E-15\/page-95.html?txthl=224#s-224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">224<\/a>, of the <em>Excise Tax Act<\/em> that affords companies like my client a statutory right of action to sue for the HST as though it was a debt owing to us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He says there are two preconditions to using the section: the plaintiff pays the outstanding tax and then sends the tax invoice or invoices to the buyer of the goods.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo, we paid the tax and complied with the invoices to the defendants, and then we sued in 2016, about seven months after being assessed and paying the tax,\u201d Huberman says. \u201cWe fell under the section and we had a right to sue.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He says the defence raised one issue: what limitation period \u2014 if any \u2014 applied? The defendants argued that time limitations in both the <em>Excise<\/em> and <em>Limitations Acts<\/em> had expired.<\/p>\n<p>Superior Court Justice James F. Diamond found the <em>Excise Tax Act<\/em> \u201cdoes not contain any time limit within which the plaintiff must bring its legal proceeding.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The court also found the plaintiff\u2019s action was within the time limitations imposed by the <em>Ontario Limitations Act<\/em>, which formed the basis of the defendants\u2019 argument.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe got everything we asked for,\u201d Huberman says. \u201cIt was a complete success for my client.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>He calls the ruling a \u201csignificant point of law\u201d since it clarifies the absence of time limitations within a s. 224 suit. In the October hearing, he argued that the clock in the provincial limitation statute starts ticking at the moment it is legally discovered.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe court says when you\u2019re dealing with this kind of action, there is a two-year period that is applicable,\u201d Huberman says. \u201cThen the question becomes \u2018when did that two-year period start?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Diamond agreed with Huberman\u2019s contention that the plaintiff didn\u2019t \u201cpossess any cause for action\u201d until the CRA acted.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile I do not condone the delay on the part of the plaintiff to properly invoice the subject transactions, the bottom line is that the plaintiff could not commence a legal proceeding until the CRA audit resulted in the payment by the plaintiff of the outstanding HST,\u201d Diamond ruled.<\/p>\n<p>And that\u2019s when it was time for his client to launch the action, Huberman says.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Rob Lamberti AdvocateDaily.com Toronto litigator and commercial arbitrator\u00a0Marvin Huberman\u00a0says a recent sales tax\u00a0ruling\u00a0in one of his cases establishes time limitations for launching an action for unpaid remittances.
