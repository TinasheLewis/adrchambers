They have five days to acknowledge a complaint and 90 days to investigate and provide a response.<\/p>\n<p>They must give clear information to their clients about the process, including their options if they\u2019re unhappy with the final result. They include taking their complaint to the OBSI or to private arbitration through an IIROC-sponsored program administered by ADR Chambers.<\/p>\n<p>Doug Melville, OBSI\u2019s ombudsman and CEO, explains its function by comparing it to a court of appeal. \u201cIf you\u2019re a customer with a complaint, you have to go through the firm\u2019s internal process first. If you\u2019re not successful, then you come to us.<\/p>\n<p>If the client is still not happy, they can still go to court, but at what threshold is it economic to litigate when you\u2019re up against a big financial institution? We have 14,000 contacts a year, and most of those would not be economic or time-efficient to go through the courts.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In response to the new rules, Melville and his staff are preparing to receive an increased number of complaints once the first 90 days have elapsed since their inception, adding a further challenge after what he calls the \u201cwild times\u201d of recent years.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith the market downturn on the investment side and the economic downturn on the banking side, complaints have been up 300 per cent in the last three years,\u201d he says. \u201cThe growth rate has now leveled off at a new normal \u2014 higher than the historic level, and it may now accelerate again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Melville\u2019s office keeps close ties with the dealer firms to see how busy they are. \u201cIt\u2019s like an early warning system,\u201d he notes. \u201cIt\u2019s always within a firm\u2019s control to try to resolve a dispute within the 90 days. I expect everything to be busier but I remain to be proven wrong.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>An alternative venue is ADR Chambers via IIROC\u2019s voluntary arbitration program. It\u2019s currently undergoing a review after a sharp decline in use in recent years. Although it\u2019s opened more than 500 cases since its inception in 1996, last year it opened only eight cases across the country.<\/p>\n<p>IIROC\u2019s preliminary report speculates the program\u2019s award limit of $100,000, the expansion of the OBSI\u2019s mandate in 2002 to deal with investment industry complaints, and its ability to award compensation of up to $350,000 are the main factors in the decline. A period for comments on the report expired on March 16.<\/p>\n<p>ADR Chambers also provides an ombuds service for complaints by customers of the Royal Bank of Canada as Canadian banks must make an external third-party dispute resolution mechanism available to their clients.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThere is no government-funded ombuds organization for banking and investment disputes, and unless and until there is, the banks have to fund it themselves,\u201d says Bette Shifman, ADR Chambers\u2019 banking ombudsperson.<\/p>\n<p>The ADR Chambers ombuds group contains six investigators, who are all lawyers with extensive mediation, arbitration, and negotiation training. \u201cWe try to deal with the complaint at several levels without holding any kind of formal proceeding,\u201d says Shifman. \u201cWe try to settle and if we can\u2019t, we investigate.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The group operates under circumscribed terms of reference. \u201cIf people are complaining that they didn\u2019t get the best interest rate, we can\u2019t help them,\u201d says Shifman. \u201cWe can\u2019t interfere with the commercial decisions of the bank.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like OBSI, the ADR Chambers Ombuds makes a non-binding recommendation but publishes any refusal to comply with it.<\/p>\n<p>Another new regulation on the block is pushing players in the securities industry towards third-party dispute resolution.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the United States and other developed markets, Canada has no federal securities regulator, so the Canadian Securities Administrators passed new rules imposing a national registration regime that includes enhanced processes for handling customer complaints.<\/p>\n<p>They give portfolio managers and investment counsel firms two years to develop a third-party dispute system.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey are not required to use us but could if they want to,\u201d Melville says. \u201cThe rule leaves it open to them to choose. At present, these firms are using OBSI as part of the Investment Funds Institute of Canada group, which helped found OBSI in 2002. The new arrangement throws the door open.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>ADR Chambers intends to offer these firms an alternative to OBSI. Portfolio management and investment counsel registrants have the two years to be in compliance, but Shifman hopes to have something to offer them soon.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRight now, we are thinking of mediation followed by an investigation similar to the ombuds program with a non-binding recommendation. We are listening to the industry as to what will meet their needs.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>By Judy van Rhijn | Publication Date: Monday, 19 April 2010 | Law Times Key investment, banking, and securities organizations are realigning their internal procedures to satisfy new complaint-handling rules designed to give investors and customers access to straightforward and expeditious dispute resolution.
